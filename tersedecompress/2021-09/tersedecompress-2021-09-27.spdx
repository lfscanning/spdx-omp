The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes. For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Ruelle-Takens scenario|transition to turbulence of a fluid]]. The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random. In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories.

Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples, another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy, and a sister was married into the locally important Carafa family - connections which might help explain the cornucopia of major commissions which fell into Caravaggio's lap in that city.

[[BuÃ©e]]'s paper was not published until 1806, in which year [[Jean-Robert Argand]] also issued a pamphlet on the same subject. It is to Argand's essay that the scientific foundation for the graphic representation of complex numbers is now generally referred. Nevertheless, in 1831 Gauss found the theory quite unknown, and in 1832 published his chief memoir on the subject, thus bringing it prominently before the mathematical world. Mention should also be made of an excellent little treatise by [[Mourey]] (1828), in which the foundations for the theory of directional numbers are scientifically laid. The general acceptance of the theory is not a little due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex n

© cell is a type of primary (non-rechargeable) battery. In the 1860s, [[Gaston PlantÃ©|Raymond Gaston PlantÃ©]] invented the [[lead-acid battery]]. He immersed two thin solid lead plates separated by rubber sheets in a dilute sulfuric acid solution to make a secondary (rechargeable) battery. The original invention had a short shelf life, though. Around 1881, [[Ãmile Alphonse Faure]], with his colleagues, developed batteries using a mixture of [[lead]] [[oxide]]s for the positive plate electrolyte. These had faster reactions and higher efficiency. In 1878, the air cell battery was developed. In 1897, [[Nikola Tesla]] researched a lightweight [[carbide]] cell and an oxygen-hydrogen storage cell. In 1898 [[Nathan Stubblefield]] received approval for a battery patent (US600457): this electrolytic coil patent is referred to as an &quot;[[earth battery]]&quot;.

(c) Endangerment of other species and (d) Loss of irreplacable genetic material and associated biochemicals. The loss of a species in and of itself is an important factor, both as diminution of the enjoyment of nature and as a moral issue for those who believe humans are stewards of the natural environment. Destabilization is a well understood outcome, when an element of food or predation is removed from an ecosystem. Examples abound that other species are in turn affected, such that population increases or declines are forthcoming in these secondary species. Drastic change or an unstable spiral can ensue, until other species are lost and the ecosystem structure is changed markedly and irreversibly.

It is today most famous for having been preserved, along with [[Pompeii]], in the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] beginning on [[August 24]], A.D. [[79]] that destroyed the towns, burying them in superheated pyroclastic material that has solidified into volcanic tufa. The [[pyroclastic flow]] instantly killed all residents who had not escaped before it struck. In contrast to Pompeii, the bodies of those killed at Herculaneum are not preserved in casts; however, hundreds of skeletons have been discovered, mostly on what was once the ancient beach. Herculaneum was a smaller town with a wealthier population than Pompeii at the time of its destruction.

This was expanded in March [[1958]] to also cover the [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom]], and the name ''European Parliamentary Assembly'' was adopted. The body was renamed to the ''European Parliament'' in [[1962]]. In [[1979]] the parliament's membership was expanded again and its members began to be directly elected for the first time. Thereafter the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined; the membership was adjusted upwards in [[1994]] after [[German reunification]]. Recent treaties, including the [[Treaty of Nice]] and the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], set a cap on membership at 750.

Copyright Act]]
Copyright Act 1911 (the [[1911]] [[Act of parliament|Act]]), removed the concept of common law copyright protection from [[British law]], and it also provided specific protection for government works for the first time. Crown copyright was defined to extend to any work prepared or published by or under the direction or control of [[George V of the United Kingdom|His Majesty]] or any Government department. The Copyright Act 1956 (the [[1956]] Act) further extended Crown copyright protection by extending the definition to include every original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work made by or under the direction or control of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty]] or a Government department; sound recordings or cinematograph films made by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or a Government department and works first published in the UK, if first published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or a Government department.

As this case was one of the first major test cases for the DMCA, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] became involved, and for a while negotiations were ongoing to resolve the case without a trial. The negotiations failed however, and Blizzard won the case on all counts: the defendants were ruled to have breached both Blizzard's [[End User License Agreement]] (EULA) and the [[Terms of Use]] of Battle.net.

''See'' 17 U.S.C. § 101 (&quot;compilation&quot; as defined by the [[United States Copyright Act]] includes compilations of data). The standard for such originality is fairly low; for example, business listings have been found to meet this standard when deciding which companies should be listed and categorizing those companies required some kind of expert judgement. ''See Key Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chinatown Today Pub. Enters.'', 945 F.2d 509 (2d Cir. 1991) (applying ''Feist''). As such, implementation of this treaty would not overrule ''Feist''.
Copyright Act''' ('''DMCA''') is a [[United States]] [[copyright]] [[law]]. The act criminalizes production and dissemination of technology that can [[circumvention|circumvent]] measures taken to protect copyright, not merely infringement of copyright itself, and heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on [[May 14]], [[1998]] by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on [[October 28]], [[1998]], the DMCA amended title 17 of the [[US Code]] to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of Online Providers from [[copyright infringement]] by their users.
Copyright Act]] (DMCA), which criminalized the production and dissemination of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology, specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM (digital rights management) technology. This had a very serious potential impact on the cryptography community: after all, an argument could be made that virtually ''any'' cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. The [[FBI]] has not enforced the DMCA this rigorously, but nonetheless, it remains a contentious issue in the cryptography community.

copyright &amp;mdash; copyright law protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas, and so while citing the source for an idea prevents plagiarism, it is not necessarily needed to avoid infringing copyright if exact words are not used. On the other hand, one can plagiarize a work that is not protected by copyright. Noncommercial use is invariably fair''. Not true, though a judge may take the profit motive or lack thereof into account.
copyright (and a patent) is generally subject to a statutorily-determined term, whereas a trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely if the trademark is periodically used and renewal fees continue to be duly paid to the relevant jurisdiction's trade marks office or [[registry]]. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the [[public domain]] and may be freely used or exploited by anyone, as courts in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publically available. It is completely incorrect, for instance, that simply posting material on the Internet places the material into the public domain such that anyone can freely copy, adapt or commercially exploit the work. Apart from anything else, the material may have been posted by someone who had no right to do so, let alone the power to waive copyright.
copyright]] and [[defamation]], more general restrictions may include restrictions on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine [[human rights]], on the promotion or justification of [[terrorism]], and in some cases on &quot;anti-western&quot; ideas. In the United States more than in Europe, during the [[Cold War]], such restrictions generally applied to [[Communism|Communists]], now they are mainly applied to Islamists. Freedom of the press]] and access to alternative information sources is considered a characteristic of liberal democracy. For certain groups, however, it may be limited: [[Islamist]] media now face restrictions in many democracies, including [[censorship]] of satellite broadcasting in France, and proposed bans on Islamist websites in several countries. Freedom of association]] is also restricted in democracies, for groups considered a threat to state or society. Most democracies have procedures to ban organisations, on suspicion of [[terrorism]], for ins
copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some 'skill, originality and work' which has gone into it. However, even fairly trivial amounts of these qualities are sufficient for determining whether a particular act of copying constitutes an infringement of the author's original expression. In [[Australia]], it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work.

copyright) and those that grant a right to prevent others from doing something. The difference between these is that a copyright would prevent someone from copying the material form of expression of an idea, but could not stop them from expressing the same idea in a different form, nor from using the same form of expression if they had no knowledge of the original held by the copyright holder. Patents and trade marks on the other hand, can be used to prevent that second person from making the same design even if they had never heard of or seen the claimed &quot;property&quot;. Those rights must be applied for or registered and are more expensive to enforce.
copyright (and trademark) infringement can still occur even when the infringers do not profit; however, the non-profit nature of fan fiction is important legally, because it limits or eliminates the damages that a court could find and also makes possible some defense against claims of infringement under copyright [[fair use]].
copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable. Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

copyright as a concept to grant authors rights, but feel that it &quot;outlives its welcome&quot; by granting copyright for too long, far beyond the lifetime of the author, and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her. This is typically attributed to corporate [[lobbying]].

This approach uses copyleft primarily as a tool in a broadly scaled [[culture jamming|sniggling]] operation, whose aim is to permanently reverse such restrictions.
copyright]] as a means to ensure [[royalties]] are payed to copyright holders. Also [[digital libraries]] such as [[Project_Gutenberg]] have come into being which make [[public domain]] texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive [[computer game]]s or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for [[fan fiction]] can be found online, where loyal followers of specific [[fictional realm]]s create and distribute derivative stories. Through open writing systems like [[wiki]]s, collaboratively written fiction is also becoming possible (see the [http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikifiction Wikifiction] initiative).
copyright as a whole fall broadly into two camps: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never been of net benefit to society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] (&quot;Rights of the Author&quot;), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the concept of copyright.
copyright as defined in [[statute law]]. Instead they fall under the purvue of the [[royal prerogative]] and as such they are perpetual in subsistence. Publishers are licensed to reproduce the Book of Common Prayer under [[letters patent]]. In [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] the letters patent are held by the [[Queen's Printer]], and in [[Scotland]] by the [[Scottish Bible Board]]. The office of Queen's Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for many years, with the earliest known reference coming in 1577. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the Queen's Printer is [[Cambridge University Press]]. CUP inherited the right of being Queen's Printer when they took over the firm of [[Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode]] in the late 20th century. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode had been Queen's Printer since 1901.

Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions may apply in such cases, the risks and the pressure from insurance companies usually prevents the use of materials without permission.
copyright cannot be placed on the source code, making the source code in the public domain. Because of this, it has been used for rapid development of applications across a number of organizations, including commercial products.
copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange them it would destroy the copyright owned in the data.
copyright case in the United States, Wheaton v. Peters, established that copyright was not a natural right or a common law right. Although the case was later nullified when the Supreme Court declared it null and void, it soon became a symbol for the morality of copyright. When the United States signed the Berne Convention, they stipulated that the Convention's &quot;moral rights&quot; provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering libel and slander.

copyright covers the expression of an idea, not the idea itself &amp;mdash; this is called the idea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy. For example, if a book is written describing a new way to organize books in a library, a copyright does not prohibit a reader from freely using and describing that concept to others; it is only the particular expression of that process as originally described that is covered by copyright. One might be able to obtain a [[patent]] for the method, but that is a different area of law. Compilations of facts or data may also be copyrighted, but such a copyright is thin; it only applies to the particular selection and arrangement of the facts, not to the particular facts themselves. In some jurisdictions databases are expressly covered by statute.

The legal ownership of the character continues to be rather murky.
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the [[United States]], the fair use doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined, however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Australia, the [[fair dealing]] exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyright material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and criti

copyrighted &amp;mdash; the dispute was based on the fact that King had made his speech publicly to a large audience both live and televised, and only one month later did he register for copyright of his speech (as was then required by [[United States copyright law|U.S. copyright law]]). Finally, on November 5, 1999, in ''[[Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]'', the 11th circuit of the United States Court of Appeals ruled that the public performance of his speech did not constitute &quot;general publication&quot; nor did it forfeit his copyright. Thus, King's [[estate]] is able to forbid redistribution of the speech or require a license fee, but they have since made the speech available to the [[Douglass Archives of American Public Address]] under terms that grant permission to &quot;download, reprint, and/or otherwise redistribute this file, provided this distribution statement is included and appropriate point of origin credit is given to the preparer and Dougl

copyrighted characters presented in sexual situations. It usually refers to printed manga, but can also refer to any type of visual work depicting copyrighted characters, including video games, animation, and CG artwork. Familiarity with a particular character or setting can add a sense of relating to the character over a generic character used in mainstream hentai, making dōjinshi more appealing to fans of a particular work. Despite not representing characters and licensed properties as intended, companies often view these works as a free form of license recognition and advertising through dedicated fandom. Some mangakas create hentai dojinshi with characters from their own mangas. Like [[Kazushi Hagiwara]] who create himself &quot;Bastard - Expansion&quot;, a hentai doujin with characters from [[Bastard!!]].

The least that can be said is that copylefting in art tends toward keeping the art thus produced as much as possible out of the commercial arena&amp;mdash;which is considered as an intrinsic positive goal by some.

copyrighted work, following adoption of the [[WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (which in turn requires, inter alia, the implementation of the relevant provisions in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]). Two key moral rights are the right not to have the work altered or destroyed without consent, and the right to be attributed as the author of the work.
copyrighted work have been sued for infringement by the targets of their ridicule, even though such use may be protected as fair use. The fair use cases addressing parodies distinguish between parodies &amp;mdash; using a work in order to poke fun or comment on the work itself &amp;mdash; and satires &amp;mdash; using a work to poke fun or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include&amp;mdash;
copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it, teach students about it, and possibly for other uses. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though he may sell his review commercially. But a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.
Copyrighted works replicated onto digital media are easily and trivially copied via [[file sharing]]. Attempts to prevent this have been largely unsuccessful, and file sharing almost never results in severe consequences for the violators. Producers of copyrighted material often attribute losses in their sales to online copying, yet they generally continue to produce material and make profits. This lack of apparent effect has been gradually eroding the belief that copyright as presently constructed is indispensable. A few artists actually support the file sharing of their own works, arguing that it expands their audience to include people who would not otherwise be able or willing to legally purchase their material.
copyright]]ed works whose [[license]]s honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because the law by default grants copyright holders [[monopoly|monopolistic control]] over their creations, copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.
copyrighted work that has been imported into the new work. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, e.g., a few sentences of a text for a book review, the more likely that the sample will be considered fair use. Yet see ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' for a case in which substantial copying &amp;mdash; entire programs for private viewing &amp;mdash; was upheld as fair use. Conversely, in ''[[Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]]'', [[Case citation|471 U.S. 539]] ([[1985]]), the use of less than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s memoir by a political opinion magazine was interpreted as infringement because those few words represented &quot;the heart of the book&quot; and were, as such, substantial.

copyright-enforced monopoly rents[http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html]. Instead, these products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain; such a license is called a ''[[copyleft]]'' or ''[[free software license]]''.
copyright enforcement in South Asia is still hit or miss, Bollywood and Hollywood are much more aware of each other now, and Indian audiences are more familiar with foreign movies and music. Blatant plagiarism ''may'' have diminished -- however, there is no general agreement that it has.
Copyright enforcement was lax in South Asia. As for the Western sources, the Bollywood film industry was largely unknown to Westerners, who would not even be aware that their material was being copied. Audiences also may not have been aware of the plagiarism, since many in the Indian audience were unfamiliar with Western films and tunes.

copyright explained]
copyright. First, the expansion of mercantilist trade in major European cities and the appearance of the secular [[university]] helped produce an educated [[bourgeois]] class interested in the information of the day. This helped spur the emergence of a “[[public sphere]],” which was increasingly served by entrepreneurial “stationers” who would produce copies of books on demand. Second, [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s development of [[printing press|movable type]] and the development and spread of the [[printing press]] made mass reproduction of printed works quick and cheap. Before these two developments, the process of copying a work could be nearly as [[labor intensive]] and expensive as creating the original, and was largely relegated to monastic [[scribes]]. It appears [[publishers]], rather than [[authors]], were the first to seek restrictions on copying printed works. Given that publishers now obtain the copyright from the authors as a condition of mass reproduction of
copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir of his 1912 will: Lovecraft's aunt, [[Annie Gamwell]]. Gamwell herself perished in 1941 and the copyrights then passed to her remaining descendants, [[Ethel Phillips Morrish]] and Edna Lewis. Morrish and Lewis then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting [[Arkham House]] to republish Lovecraft's works but retaining the copyrights for themselves. Searches of the [[Library of Congress]] have failed to find any evidence that these copyrights were then renewed after the 28 year period and, hence, it is likely that these works are now in the public domain.

copyright (given that copyright laws have proven unenforceable), copyright holders use the legal system to apply extortion by charging for products that are readily available for free. [[Bill Gates]] is on record as saying that there is no way technically of preventing copyrighted digital material being replicated, so future attempts to enforce copyrights may become uneconomic, as well as unpopular politically. In the meantime, companies or indviduals held by a court to have infringed copyright may be required to pay substantial amounts in damages. A recent and highly visible example is the Australian [[Kazaa]] case, ''Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd'' [2005] FCA 1242 ([[5 September]] [[2005]]); the company operating the Kazaa file-sharing system and individuals associated with it were held to have authorised infringement of copyright in musical recordings. The recording industry is expected to seek multimillion dollar damages.

copyright has expired or has been relinquished. However, such a work is still considered free content, because it may be used for any purpose whatsoever. Free content can be viewed by all at no cost.
copyright has relatively recently been made automatic, which has had the effect of making it more like a property right. Thus, as with property, a copyright need not be granted or obtained through official registration with the government. Once an idea has been reduced to material form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape or a letter), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights. However, while a copyright need not be officially registered for the copyright owner to begin exercising his exclusive rights, registration of works (where the laws of that jurisdiction provide for registration) does have its benefits: serving as [[prima facie]] evidence of a valid copyright and enabling the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees (whereas in the USA, for instance, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits).

A common and simple practice to obtain evidence in favour of authorship is to place the copyright material in an envelope or package together with a document signed by several people stating that they have examined the work prior to it being sealed and that in their opinion it is original. Once this is done the package is mailed to the owner by recorded delivery, which helps to establish when the work was created, who the originator of the work is and that there are signatory validators prepared to state that it is original. Once this process is complete the package and contents may be able to be used in a court of law as evidence if necessary.

This means that if the defendant's actions do not constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's rights (for example, because the plaintiff's work was not copyrighted, or the defendant's work did not borrow from it sufficiently), fair use does not even arise as an issue.

To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and worldviews of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.

In ''Howell v Miller'', (91 F 129 (1898)) Justice Harlan denied an injunction sought for the compiler of [[Michigan]] [[statutes]], holding that “no one can obtain the exclusive right to publish the laws of the state in a book prepared by him.” The question of formal ownership of the text of laws and decisions is perhaps secondary to the question of the dissemination of the law.
copyright in jurisdictions which have acceded to the Berne Convention. In most jurisdictions a work may be copyrighted from the moment of its creation regardless of whether or not it bears a copyright notice. However, the existence of a copyright notice may make it easier to claim certain [[damages]] for [[infringement]] in [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]], as a [[defendant]] may be presumed to have ignored the notice and intentionally infringed copyright.

copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.

copyright in statutes and court and administrative tribunal decisions is one that is rarely litigated. It has been used by some governments to justify a refusal to publish the laws electronically and to justify using the laws to generate revenues. One way to challenge these arguments is to question the legal theory of copyright in the laws, but perhaps the better way is to focus on the policy choices and arguments relating to access to the laws.
copyright in statutes and regulations, by permitting anyone to make copies without permission for any purpose – except commercial – while the other jurisdictions make fairly strongly worded prohibitions against copying the laws for anything other than personal use. It appears that perhaps the intent of these notices is to prevent copying by commercial publishers of the electronic version as prepared by the government, while permitting commercial publishers to manually type (or optically scan) the text of statutes if they wish to publish individual statutes (presumably with some value added to the raw legislative text).
Copyright''' (international symbol: '''©''') is a set of [[exclusive rights]] granted by [[government]]s to regulate the use of a particular expression of an idea or information. At its most general, it is literally &quot;the right to copy&quot; an original creation. In most cases, these rights are of limited duration.
copyright in the database structure. This notion was opposed by the United States Supreme Court in 1991 in the Feist Publication finding, which said that exclusive rights cannot cover the factual elements of any copyrighted work, that copyright does not derive from the effort expended in the production of the work, and that in the case of a collection of information, only the originality that may be found in the selection and arrangement of the information is governed by copyright. This case holds that the purpose of exclusive rights policy is to provide information to the public, and this consideration takes priority over concerns such as investment. A study has found that the introduction of exclusive rights to databases in the EU did not do any good to the economy.

copyright in the United States==
copyright in the United States automatically attaches upon the creation of an original work of authorship, registration with the copyright office puts a copyright holder in a better position if litigation arises over the copyright. A copyright holder desiring to register his or her copyright should do the following:
copyright in the work shall ... belong to Her Majesty and ... shall continue for the remainder of the calendar year of the first publication of the work and for a period of fifty years following the end of that calendar year'' The Crown's ownership in its works is no more limited than those of any private persons. In practice, government materials are often licensed to the public for non-commercial use under the conditions that 1) due diligence is taken to ensure accuracy, 2) the source is identified, and 3) the material is not represented as an official version. Absent any licence available from the source of the material, there is no presumption that any government material is subject to such a licence.
copyright in United States law followed the [[sweat of the brow]] doctrine that gave copyright to anyone who invested significant amount of time and energy into their work. At trial and appeal level the courts followed this doctrine siding for Rural.
copyright''' is a form of [[copyright]] claim used by the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and a number of other [[Commonwealth realms]].
Copyright is also conceived by some as an &quot;artificial barrier&quot; in that &quot;expressions&quot; could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[state]] does not necessarily possess the moral authority to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws.
copyright is asserted for generating revenue, licensing should be based on the principles of non-exclusivity and the recovery of no more than the marginal costs incurred in the reproduction of the information or data ... the federal government should create and maintain an inventory of Crown works covered by intellectual property that is of potential interest to the learning community and the information production sector at large; negotiate nonexclusive licenses for their use on the basis of cost recovery for digitization, processing and distribution; and invite provincial and territorial governments to provide similar services.
copyright is frequently no longer defended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by its owners due to the software's age or obsolescence, but sometimes because the [[corporate]] copyright holder went out of business without transferring ownership, leaving no one to defend the copyright. (Copyrights on works created by an individual become the property of that person's [[estate (law)|estate]] after his/her death.) Nevertheless, some companies vehemently defend their rights to old games from which they're no longer making profit.

In these cases too the law accepts that the property cannot be stolen - if someone moves into a flat and prevents the original residents from living there they are not regarded as 'thieves of the lease' but as '[[squatter|squatters]]' and the law provides different remedies. [[Identity theft]] is another example of the adaptation of physical property laws to intangible items, though that term itself is seen as problematic by some.
copyright is likely enforceable.
copyright]], is more often used to restrict usage of a file format. Although patents for file formats are not directly permitted under US law, some formats require the encoding of data with patented [[algorithms]]. For example, the GIF file format requires the use of a patented algorithm, and although initially the patent owner did not enforce it, they later began collecting fees for use of the algorithm. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the use of [[GIF]]s, and is partly responsible for the development of the alternative [[PNG]] format. However, the patent expired in the US in mid-[[2003]], worldwide in mid-[[2004]]; algorithms are themselves not currently patentable under European law.
Copyright is often called a &quot;negative right&quot;, as it serves to prohibit people (e.g. readers, viewers, or listeners) from doing something, rather than permit people (e.g. authors) to do something. In this way it is similar to the unregistered design right in [[English law]] and [[European law]].
copyright is originality&quot;. However, the standard for creativity is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a &quot;spark&quot; or &quot;minimal degree&quot; of creativity to be protected by copyright.
copyright is owned by The Community of Christ, previously called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)-Copyrights have expired, so this statement is not accurate. Joseph Smith was not going through the Bible starting with page 1 and correcting it. He actually was doing this translation by subject. Therefore one verse in The Community of Christ's JST Bible may be correct, while the two surrounding verses may still be flawed. (CORRECTION: The Church does not use the JST of the Bible because it was never completed - See Comment by clicking 'Edit this Page')--&gt; the Bible issued by the Church contains cross references to the Joseph Smith Translation (JST), as well as an appendix containing major excerpts from it. Though it is part of the canon and members believe the Bible to be the word of God, the Church also acknowledges that numerous omissions and mistranslations occured in even the earliest known manuscripts, although the relative majority of what remains i
copyright is still in effect. Abandonware changes hands based on the presumption that the time and money that a copyright holder would have to spend enforcing the copyright is greater than any money the holder would earn selling software licenses. Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights. For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that makes money by selling Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.

They can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.

This would allow, in essence, the creation of a book which would disintegrate after one reading. As individuals have proven adept at circumventing such measures in the past, many copyright holders have also successfully lobbied for laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which uses criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital &quot;rights management&quot; systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC).

copyright law and the wrongs he perceived it perpetuating, he decided to work within the framework of existing [[law]]; he created his own copyright license, the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), the first copyleft license. For the first time a copyright holder had taken steps to ensure that the maximal number of rights be perpetually transferred to a program's users, no matter what subsequent revisions anyone made to the original program. This original GPL did not grant rights to the public at large, only those who had already received the program; but it was the best that could be done under existing law. The new license was not at this time given the copyleft label.
copyright law as an entity, and is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[moral right]]. Many argue that copyright does not exist merely to restrict third parties from publishing ideas and information, and that defining copyright purely as a negative right is contrary to the public policy objective of encouraging authors to create new works and enrich the public domain.
copyright law as fan fiction is about reinterpreting officially sanctioned texts and reinventing them for the fan's own needs. As such, fan fiction cannot exist until the first copyright law, which went on the books in 1620 in England. The third theory holds that fan fiction did not officially start until the creation of Star Trek fandom and the printing of original stories by fans in their own fanzines. This theory acknowledges that much of the groundwork was laid by the science fiction fandom. Using this last theory of when fan fiction started, pastiche traditions al la Sherlock Holmes and Real Person Fic are not part of the fan fiction community because of vastly differing cultural practices.

A limiting case in [[mathematical model]]ling. In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], the [[behaviorism]] sees the human mind as a black box, see [[black box theory]]. The opposite of a ''black box'' -- a system where the innards are available for inspection (e.g. a [[free software]]/[[open-source software|open source]] program) is sometimes known as a [[White box (software engineering)|white box]], a glass box, or a clear box.
copyright law as &quot;bizarre and contradictory&quot; because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect. This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than from laws about copyright. This debate is still open in the courts.
copyright law as soon as it leaves that person's mind and is placed in some physical form, be it a painting, a musical work written in manuscript or an architectural schematic. Once in physical form, as long as it is an original work (in the sense of not having been copied from an existing work, rather than in the sense of being novel or unique), copyright in that work is automatically vested in (i.e. owned by) the person who put the concept into material form. There may be exceptions to this rule, depending on the nature of the work, whether it was created in the course of employment and the purposes for which the work was created.

copyright law|copyright law]] has a fair use doctrine based largely, or even exactly, on the doctrine adopted in the United States.
Copyright law covers only the particular form or manner in which ideas or information have been manifested, the &quot;form of material expression&quot;. It is not designed or intended to cover the actual idea, concepts, facts, styles, or techniques which may be embodied in or represented by the copyright work. Copyright law provides scope for satirical or interpretive works which themselves may be copyrighted. See [[idea-expression divide]].
copyright law covers the creative or artistic expression of an idea, patent law covers [[invention]]s, trademark law covers distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s which are used in relation to [[product (business)|products]] or [[services]] as indicators of origin, registered designs law covers the look or appearance of a manufactured or functional article and the [[trade secret|law of confidential information]] covers secret or sensitive knowledge or information.
copyright law defines derivative works. In ''[[Galoob v. Nintendo]]'' the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] defined a derivative work as having &quot;'form' or permanence&quot; and noted that &quot;the infringing work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form,&quot; but there have been no clear court decisions to resolve this particular conflict.
Copyright law does ''not'' restrict anyone from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the [[United States]] this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s. Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder of their licensee to control the [[aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed '''does''' infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which applies to patents and trademark rights.

This has not taken off, perhaps in part because patents are relatively expensive to obtain, whereas copyright is obtained for free.
copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software is old enough for its copyrights to have expired, and even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually still belong to someone.

copyright law, in some respects. The American threshold for copyright protection does contain requirements of both originality and creativity. According to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc v Nation Enterprises'', a work “must be original to the author”. The United States Supreme Court has also interpreted Article I, § 8, cl 8 of the United States Constitution as requiring “independent creation plus a modicum of creativity”.

copyright law. In the [[public domain]] the absence of copyleft-like protection leaves software in an unprotected state. Developers basing their work on public domain originals can spread and sell undocumented [[Binary and text files|binaries]] without providing the source code. If legal copyright was abolished and without other means, then there would be no method for protecting or enforcing a copyleft license, but the need to do so would also be diminished (except from [[software hoarding]]).
copyright law]] is seen by the original proponents of copyleft as a way to restrict the right to make and redistribute copies of a particular work, a copyleft license uses copyright law in order to ensure that every person who receives a copy or derived version of a work can use, modify, and also redistribute both the work, and [[Derivative work|derived versions of the work]]. Thus, in a non-legal sense, copyleft is the opposite of copyright. &lt;!--See discussion page of this article--&gt;

While it may be true that Ivy coined the term and drew 2 logos in 1999, she tried to sell the concept to Hollywood before properly registering either trademark or copyright, and some Hollywood people used her concept as a starting point for their own unique work.
copyright law more conservative in deciding ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', 537 U.S. 186, which affirmed the legality of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], an act that extended the current copyright terms by an ''extra'' 20 years. The decision noted that, so long as a copyright term is finite, it is permissible under the Constitution. Thus, a copyright in the United States is protected by the full strength of the law until it expires, between 70 and 120 years after initial creation.

There seems to be no easy answer to such threats, while it is considered that generally communities developing copylefted products have neither the resources nor the organization for complex patenting procedures.

In particular, the Committee was &quot;emphatic&quot; that the Crown lose its unique position of gaining copyright over material whenever it is the first publisher of such material. (For example, a previously unpublished short story, upon being published in a government work, would cease to belong to the author and would instead become Crown copyright, denying the author any future royalties.)

copyright laws dates to 1834, when the Supreme Court interpreted the first federal copyright laws and held that “no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court … “ In the same case it was argued – and accepted by the Court – that “it would be absurd, for a legislature to claim the copyright; and no one else can do it, for they are the authors, and cause them to be published without copyright … Statutes were never copyrighted.” Further, “it is the bounden duty of government to promulgate its statutes in print”. Counsel emphasised the governing policy that “all countries … subject to the sovereignty of the laws” hold the promulgation of the laws, from whatever source, “as essential as their existence.” “If either statutes or decisions could be made private property, it would be in the power of an individual to shut out the light by which we guide our actions.” (''Wheaton v Peters'', 33 US (8 Pet) 591, 668 (

copyright laws in the member states were totally different from each other, as that could render the whole agreement useless. Of what benefit would the agreement be if an author in a country with strong protection had his book published in a country with weak or no protection?

copyright law specifically protects parody, and also includes a provision that the specifically protected categories are not necessarily the only protected categories, fan fiction remains in a legal gray area. But even without an official ruling on the legality of fan fiction, the owners of intellectual property can exert a great deal of influence on fans. For instance, a [[cease and desist]] letter from an entity with deep pockets exerts a great deal of influence on a single person who can scarcely afford legal representation. Conversely, the bad publicity and ill will generated by attacking one's own fan base can give even a large corporation second thoughts about conducting a legal campaign against fan writers.

copyright laws would usually only apply for works created within each country. Consequently, a work published in [[London]] by a British national would be protected by copyright in the [[United Kingdom]], but could be copied and sold by anyone in [[France]]; likewise, a work published in [[Paris]] by a French national would be protected by copyright in France, but could be copied and sold by anyone in the United Kingdom.

copyright licenses''', because any works derived from a copylefted work must themselves be copylefted. This language is often used by those who feel that they may lose out as a result of copyleft provisions. In particular, copyleft works cannot legally be incorporated into works that are to be distributed without source, as is the case with most commercial products, without specific permission from the authors. As a consequence, the use of copyleft in industry is overwhelmingly limited to internal use.

copyright licensing for software== Art &amp;mdash; documents=== Copyleft also inspired the arts (especially where traditional notions of [[intellectual property]] are experienced as hampering creativity and/or creative collaboration and/or easy distribution of art creations), with movements like the [[Libre Society]] and open-source [[record label]]s emerging. For example, the [[Free Art license]] is a copyleft license that can be applied to any work of art.
copyright limitations can be found in many nations' copyright statutes, though these differ in scope. Most other [[common law]] countries have a related doctrine known as ''[[fair dealing]]'', which is defined in a constrained manner through an enumerated list of causes for exemption that allows little room for [[case law|judicial interpretation]]. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries have codified similarly specific and narrowly drawn exceptions. Fair use, however, tends to be an open-ended legal doctrine, as statutory factors are balanced by U.S. judges on a case-by-case basis rather than strictly applied.

Copyright may also be [[license]]d. Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a [[statutory license]] (e g. musical works in the United States). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made. Failure to follow the proper procedures would then result in the copyist being vulnerable to an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following this process for every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performing rights organisation|performing rights organization]]s (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[RIAA]] and [[MPAA]]) have been formed to sell the rights to hundreds of works at once. Though
Copyright may be assigned or transferred from one party to another. For example, a musician who records an album will sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyrights in the recordings to the company in exchange for royalties and other terms. One might ask why a copyright holder would ever give up his rights. The answer is that large companies generally have production and marketing capabilities far beyond that of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed for a minimal cost through the [[Internet]], however the [[record industry]] attempts to provide the service of promoting and marketing the artist so that the work can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder does not have to transfer all rights completely. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy and/or distribute the work in a particular region or for a spec

A [[patent]] may be granted in relation to an [[invention]] that is new, useful and not simply an obvious advancement over what existed when the application was filed. A patent gives the holder an exclusive right to commercially exploit the invention for a certain period of time (typically 20 years from the filing date of a patent application). A [[trademark]] is a distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is used to distinguish the products or services of one [[business]] from those of another business.

Another example is [[Amstrad]], who support emulation and free distribution of [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software. Transfer of public domain or free software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware. It is uncommon for proprietary software companies to release software to the public domain or under an open source licence. However, many companies such as [[Novell]] and [[Sun]] have recently been experimenting with releasing their latest software under [[open source]] and [[free software]] licences which allow users not only to trade in the software freely but to sell and modify said software so long as they also release it under the same licence.

copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the defendant for commercial uses, but on the copyright owner for noncommercial uses. See ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'', [[Case citation|464 U.S. 417, 451]] ([[1984]]), where the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In the ''Nation'' case regarding President Ford's memoirs above, the Supreme Court labelled this factor &quot;the single most important element of fair use&quot; (471 U.S. at 566) and it has indeed enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since.

copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. When Dirks left Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Pulitzer (unusual, since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst) Hearst in a highly unusual court decision retained the rights to the name &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters. Hearst promptly hired a cartoonist named Harold Knerr to draw his own version of the strip. Dirks renamed his version ''Hans and Fritz'' (later, ''The Captain and The Kids''). Thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades. Dirks' version, eventually distributed by United Feature Syndicate, ran until 1979.
copyright owner's official trailers. See ''[[Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista]]'', [[Case citation|342 F.3d 191]] ([[3d Cir.]] [[2003]]). On the other hand, one might well question whether [[Roland Barthes]]' ''S/Z'' clearly supersedes [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s short story &quot;Sarrasine&quot; as a market replacement, since it reproduces the entirety of the latter, though only in short fragments followed by much critical explication by Barthes. Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the licensing of course-pack copies. See ''[[Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan Document Services]]'', [[Case citation|99 F.3d 1381]] ([[6th Cir.]] 1999).

However, statutory abandonment is a relatively unclear area of copyright law and the more common approach is to license work under a scheme that provides for public use rather than strictly abandoning copyright. For more information consult [[Public_domain#Disclaimer of interest|&quot;disclaimer of interest&quot;]]. In the military practice and law, abandonment of a military post by a soldier can be called [[desertion]], and the condition of being away from that post can be called [[Desertion#AWOL: Away WithOut Leave|being &quot;Away Without Leave&quot;]].

Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but may now become more commonplace as the copyright collectives like the [[RIAA]] are more and more targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far however, these cases have usually been settled outside of court, with demands of payment of several thousand dollars accompanied by nothing more than a threat to sue the file sharer, thus such cases do not even make it to civil law courts in reality.

In [[September 2003]], the OCLC sued the [[Library Hotel]] for trademark infringement. The settlement was that the OCLC would allow the Library Hotel to use the system in its hotel and marketing. In exchange, the Hotel would acknowledge the Center's ownership of the trademark and make a donation to a nonprofit organization promoting reading and literacy among children.
copyrights between sovereign nations. Under the Berne convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically assigned: an author does not have to &quot;register&quot; or &quot;apply for&quot; a copyright. As soon as a work is &quot;fixed&quot;, that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all exclusive rights to the work and any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires.
copyright scholars believe that irrespective of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that absent legal protection of their material interests, many valuable books and pieces of art would not be created. This interest is arguably served even by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, not only because many &quot;authors&quot; and copyright holders are corporations, but also because the right of an author's heirs to continue to profit from a copyrighted work may provide a substantial part of the incentive to create. Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain. By the time works currently enter the public domain, they almost always have become obsolete.
Copyrights Designs and Patents Act 1988 (the [[1988]] Act) came into force, the scope of the definition of Crown copyright was considerably reduced. Crown copyright was defined as subsisting when a &quot;work is made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties&quot;. Crown copyright was also defined as subsisting &quot;in every Act of Parliament, Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]], Act of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] or Measure of the General Synod of the [[Church of England]]&quot;. All existing works in Crown copyright were continued as such.

copyrights for Lovecraft's works were ever renewed under the terms of the [[USA]] [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for works created prior to [[January 1]] [[1978]]. If Lovecraft's work had been renewed they would be eligible for protection for 75-95 years after the author's death according to the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998. This means the copyrights would not expire on some of Lovecraft's works until 2019 at the earliest, providing that no further laws extend the periods of copyrights within the USA. Similarly, the [[European Union]] [[Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death.

The strongest blow against police corruption came in 1986, when an increasing amount of [[conspiracy]] charges, arranged by the intervention of the mysterious Batman, against Commissioner Gillian Loeb forced him to resign his position. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled by the end of the 1980s, when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] organization. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]] in 1988, the [[Mafia]] lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising [[gang violence]], severely crippled organized crime in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corr

They were a confederacy of seven [[Magyars|Magyar]] and three allied [[Khabar]] tribes; the name Hungary / Hungarian is most probably derived from the Turkish term [[Onogur]] meaning 'Ten Arrows', signifying united military strength in nomadic symbolism. In 896 they settled temporarily around the upper [[Tisza]] river basin, in 901 around the [[Balaton]]. Subsequently they also partly occupied what is today eastern [[Austria]] and southern [[Slovakia]]. After their defeat at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, they definitively settled in the [[Carpathian basin]].

Ideally, camouflage should be made to break up and thereby conceal the structural lines of the object which it hides. Thus, the patterns often seen on camouflage clothing, masking cloth and vehicle paints are carefully constructed to deceive the human eye by breaking up the boundaries that define sharp edges and human silhouettes. This is called ''high difference'' or ''disruptive camouflage''.

This grip became popular amongst sports fencers in the late twentieth century because of the way it complemented the agility and athleticism of competitots - albeit, as critics allege, at the cost of blade sensitivity finesse. There are several types of pistol grips, such as the basic Visconti (which is what most people refer to as a pistol grip), the American, Belgian, and Russian. The various pistol grips all provide a somewhat firmer hold for the user of the weapon than would be possible with the French grip. This endows the user with a more stable grip on the weapon.

copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions, with different categories of works and the length it subsists for also depends on whether a work is published or unpublished. In most of the world the default length of copyright for many works is either life of the author plus 50 years, or plus 70 years. Copyright in general always expires at the end of the year concerned, rather than on the exact date of the death of the author. In the United States, all books and other items published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain. In the US, government documents, regardless of date, are all public domain.

Copyright Term Extension Act]] and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as evidence. Also, many argue that when the major media outlets are controlled by large corporations, access to information tends to become limited to what serves corporate interests, and corporate interests in turn are able to define the national political agenda. Finally when the majority of wealth of the politicians is invested into corporations, that gives politicians incentive to support the corporations.

copyright varies depending whether material is published or unpublished. Unpublished material was originally subject to copyright protection in perpetuity. However, the 1988 Act removed this concept from British law. Transitional provisions apply for 50 years after the entry into force of the 1988 Act which mean that no unpublished material will lose its copyright protection until [[January 1]], [[2040]]. New Crown copyright material that is unpublished has copyright protection for 125 years from date of creation. Published Crown copyright material has protection for 50 years from date of publication. Those works protected under Letters Patent have perpetual copyright claimed over them despite being published. Works where copyright is assigned to the Crown by an author are subject to the normal term of protection for that particular type of work, for example life of the author plus 70 years for a literary work.

copyright was invented. One might argue that much more invention occurred after patents came into existence; however, one could also argue that patents were brought into law as the power and influence of industrial interests grew.
Copyright was not invented until after the advent of the printing press and wider public literacy. In [[England]] the King was concerned by the unfair copying of books and used the [[royal prerogative]] to pass the Licensing Act [[1662]] which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers Company. The [[Statute of Anne]] was the first real act of copyright, and gave the author rights for a fixed period. Internationally, the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in the late [[1800s]] set out the scope of copyright protection and is still in force to this day.

He suggests that Columbus learned Spanish in Portugal through its use in Portugal as or &quot;adopted language of culture&quot; from 1450. This same Spanish is used by poets like [[FernÃ¡n Silveira]] and [[Joan Manuel]]. The first testimony of his use of Spanish is from the 1480s.

Heidegger is interested in the idea of [[Hermeneutics]], or the study of the methodological principles of interpretation. Everyone is Hermeneutic; therefore everyone is interpreting life/world as he/she encounters it. Therefore there is no final truth, everything is relative and nothing is absolute. To be human is to interpret. Along with this logical chain goes the idea of context. Heidegger states that you cannot discover anything without using your predetermined context: social, place, area, age, etc. You cannot decide upon an issue without using your already existing content. Therefore the idea of the universal, and the idea of [[Archetype]] are void. Another assault on [[Archetype]] states that since human beings value systems are based on context, therefore are relative voids Archetype. The final assault also comes from context: the idea that physical forms somehow have intrinsic value

These are, for instance, ''[[:fr:conscience|conscience]]'', and ''[[:de:Bewusstsein|Bewusstsein]]'' {{ref|Davies}}. However, it has also been argued that [[John Locke]] was in fact the first one to use the modern meaning of consciousness in his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', although it remains closely intertwined with moral conscience (I may be held [[responsibility|morally responsible]] only for the act of which I am conscious of having achieved; and my personal identity - [[self (philosophy)|my self]] - goes as far as my consciousness extends itself). The modern sense of &quot;consciousness&quot; was therefore first found not in Descartes' work - who so

Still others maintain though &quot;mind&quot; is a noun, it is not necessarily the &quot;name of a thing&quot; distinct within the whole person.

As a result, Government was often subservient to Company interests. While the company helped with building some schools, it also opposed building highways because this would compete with its railroad monopoly

© formally, we first need to fix a (Turing-complete) model of computation, for instance [[Turing machine]]s or [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] or [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] programs. (Here, ''program'' means the concatenation of executable code and input.) We then need to specify an [[Prefix code|instantaneous encoding]] of programs as [[bit]] strings. This encoding has the property that if ''w'' encodes a syntactically correct program, then no proper prefix of ''w'' encodes a syntactically correct program. Given an arbitrary Turing machine ''M'', this can always be achieved by using the following algorithm: Read a bit of the input ''z''. Before reading any more, simulate &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; on all possible extensions ''y'' (including the empty one) of ''z'' simultaneously until some extension halts, if ever. If ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z'', then halt and output ''M''(''y''); otherwise go to step 1.
© for that language must be at least ''n'' bits itself, including any input data.

Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear differential equations, were carried out by [[George David Birkhoff|G.D. Birkhoff]], [[Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]], [[Mary Lucy Cartwright|M.L. Cartwright]], [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.E. Littlewood]], and [[Stephen Smale]]. Except for Smale, these studies were all directly inspired by physics: the three-body problem in the case of Birkhoff, turbulence and astronomical problems in the case of Kolmogorov, and radio engineering in the case of Cartwright and Littlewood. Although chaotic planetary motion had not been observed, experimentalists had encountered turbulence in fluid motion and nonperiodic oscillation in radio circuits without the benefit of a theory to explain what they were seeing.

In 1928 a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara]] 'war of the hoe handle' broke out in western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, perhaps the largest anticolonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence, once again, of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.

Diderot accepted the proposal, but in his busy and pregnant intelligence the scheme became transformed. Instead of a mere reproduction of the ''Cyclopaedia'', he persuaded Le Breton to enter upon a new work, which should collect under one roof all the active writers, all the new ideas, all the new knowledge, that were then moving the cultivated class of the [[Republic of Letters]] to its depths, but still were comparatively ineffectual by reason of their dispersion.

[[Jorge Montt]], among others, directed an armed conflict against Balmaceda, which soon extended into the [[Chilean Civil War]] of [[1891]].

Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. [[July 10]], [[1997]] PP council member [[Miguel Ãngel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque city of [[Ermua]] and his death threatened unless the Spanish government would meet ETA's demands. Six million people demonstrated to demand his liberation, with demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain. After three days, ETA carried through their threat, unleashing massive demonstrations reflecting the ETA action with the cries of &quot;Assassins&quot; and &quot;Basques yes, ETA no&quot;.

On returning home to Kirkcaldy he devoted much of the next ten years to his [[magnum opus]], ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,'' which appeared in [[1776]]. It was very well-received and popular, and Smith became famous. In [[1778]] he was appointed to a comfortable post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in Edinburgh. He died there on July 17, 1790, after a painful illness and was buried in Canongate Churchyard, Royal Mile, Edinburgh. He had apparently devoted a considerable part of his income to numerous secret acts of charity.

© Morisot was relegated to the category of &quot;feminine&quot; artists because of their usual subject matter &amp;mdash; women, children, and domestic scenes. However, as a doctrinaire impressionist, Morisot painted what she saw in her immediate, everyday life. As a woman securely in the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; she saw domestic interiors, holiday spots, other women, and children. Without exception, her subject matter shows the equivalent of that of her impressionist colleagues. [[Edgar Degas]], the dandy male bourgeois, painted rehearsals of the ballet, horse races, and nude women in apartments (rather than studios). [[Claude Monet]] painted his garden, his children, and his neighbor's haystacks. Female impressionists painted their social milieu in a way consistent with the impressionist approach to subject matter.

Essentially, the perfective aspect refers to a single event conceived as a unit, while the imperfective aspect represents an event in the process of unfolding or a repeated or habitual event. In the past tense, the distinction often coincides with the distinction between the simple past &quot;X-ed&quot;, as compared to the progressive &quot;was X-ing&quot;. For example, the perfective would translate both verbs in the sentence &quot;He raised his sword and struck the enemy&quot;. However, in the sentence &quot;As he was striking the enemy, he was killed by an arrow&quot;, the first verb would be rendered by an imperfective and the second by a perfective.

He was publicly accused of being a [[Nazi]]/[[Rexism|Rexist]] sympathizer, a claim which was largely unfounded, as the Tintin adventures published during the war were scrupulously free of politics (the only dubious point occurring in ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', which showed a rival scientific expedition flying the [[Flag of the United States]]). In fact, the stories published before the war had been unequivocally critical of [[fascism]]; most prominently, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' showed Tintin working to defeat a thinly-veiled allegory of the [[Anschluss]], [[Nazi Germany]]'s takeover of [[Austria]]. Nevertheless, like other former employees of the Nazi-controlled press, HergÃ© found himself barred from newspaper work.

© was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to catch on because it meant the player had to relearn how to play the instrument. Gradually, however, it became the standard and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the [[Oehler system]] clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland and Klezmer players continue to use Albert system clarinets, as the simpler fingering system can allow for easier slurring of notes. At one time the reed was held on using string, but now the practice exists primarily in Germany and Austria, where the warmer, ''thicker'' tone is preferred over that produced with the ligatures that are more popular in the rest of the world.

Though less familiar than Fermat's Last Theorem, the [[Taniyama-Shimura theorem]] is the more significant of the two, because it touches on truly deep currents in number theory. No one had any idea how to prove it. Working in absolute secrecy, and sharing his ideas and progress only with [[Nicholas Katz]], another professor of mathematics at Princeton, Wiles eventually developed a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture, and hence of FLT. The proof is a ''tour de force'' introducing many new ideas.

copyright considerations. BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be established tomorrow, only that they seemed to fall within LC's purview, and that there should be long-range plans to establish them.

In the absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem. Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original electronic document. It becomes highly important in science to prove authorship. How will that be done?
Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials. Of course that could not be accomplished overnight, but it would be something LC could plan for. GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised by LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning some kind of directory for these kinds of materials. In a situation where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH suggested, RLIN is helpful, but it is not helpful in the case of a local, on-line catalogue. Further, one would like to have her or his system be aware that that exists in digital form, so that one can present it to a

On account of the current great shortage of digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights problems, this course of action could have a significant effect on making network multimedia a reality.
copyrighted in this country, and second, to make materials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that goes beyond Congress, BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in electronic form. This would mean eventually accepting electronic formats. LC could require that at some point they be in a certain limited set of formats, and then develop mechanisms for allowing people to access those in the same way that other things are accessed. This does not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone. LC does that with most of its bibliographic records, BESSER said, which end up migrating to the utility (e.g., OCLC) or somewhere else. But just as most of LC's books are available in some form through interlibrary loan or some other mechanism, so in the same way electronic formats ought

copyright, for example, any work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is in the public domain in the United States. The issue is not wholly free of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain outside the United States. Other materials in the public domain include: any works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work published in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose
copyright for works that were published in electronic form, including software, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty pages of code--something that represented the work but did not include the entire work itself and had little value to anyone. As a temporary measure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of electronic publications. This measure entails a proactive role for the Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version. Publishers then have perhaps a year to submit it. But the real problem for LC is what to do with all this material in all these different formats. Will the Library mount it? How will it give people access to it? How does LC keep track of the appropriate computers, software, and media? The situation is so hard to control, ERWAY said, that it makes sense for each publishing house to maintain its own archive. But LC cannot enforce that either.
copyright holding. Simply, economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in any form. They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for hire, the employer. The second right, which is critical to conversion, is the right to change a work. The right to make new versions is perhaps one of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an electronic world. The third right is the right to publish the work and the right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an electronic medium needs to know. The basic rule is if a copy is sold, all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy. The key is that it must be sold. A number of companies overcome this obstacle by leasing or renting their product. These companies argue that if the material is rented or leased and not sold, they control the uses of a work. The fourth right, and one very important in a digital world, is a right of public performance, which

copyright law in the United States. The U.S. Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with by many individuals, there is concern. If changes are authorized and there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns the changes. To put it another way, the person who acquires permission to change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless some agreement to the contrary has been made. It is typical for the original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as preservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and other libraries. But the law does not allow anyone to become the distributor of the product for the entire world. In today's electronic environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a single library. Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for example, from access and use. Hence, the development of site licenses and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they should be compensated for. Any solution that the United States takes today has to consider the international arena.
copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium, and LC can request one copy of that, or two copies if it is the only version, and can request copies of software, but that fails to address magazines or books or anything like that which is in machine-readable form.
Copyright law protects creative works. Protection granted by the law to authors and disseminators of works includes the right to do or authorize the following: reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute the work to the public, and publicly perform or display the work. In
copyright laws for two purposes: 1) to encourage the creation and dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole; and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.
copyright matters * Copyright
copyright matters, rough justice is the outcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their due. Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without paying for it; there should be some compensation. But the truth of the world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more until he becomes a big guy. That is true of every author, every composer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.
Copyright Office.
Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and totally exhaustive probably is not protected. In the event that what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable
Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not copyrightable because they are mechanical. It can be argued whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected. One must exercise care with material created with public funds and generally in the public domain. An article written by a federal employee, if written as part of official duties, is not copyrightable. However, control over a scientific article written by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy. If the government agency has no policy (and that policy can be contained in its regulations, the contract, or the grant), the
Copyright Office will ask about the creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make. As a practical matter, if one believes she or he has made enough of those

copyright problems.
copyright problems. LC must also deal with the concept of on-line publishing, determining, among other things,
copyright problem. This desideratum will require propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they can end up in other on-line catalogs. Although uncertain about the mechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of cataloging and distribution of records. It would be foolish, given the amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work. Re microforms, LYNCH said, we are in pretty good shape.
copyright protect anything that is mechanical, anything that does not involve choice, or criteria concerning whether or not one should do a thing. For example, the results of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes impure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable. On the other hand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion

copyright protection is simply originality. This is a low standard and means that a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain

copyright?, she asked, because the journal will exist in the mainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it. Here the situation is different, ownership versus access, and is something that arises with publication in the on-line environment, faster than is sometimes realized. Lacking clear answers to all of these questions herself, LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role in helping to define some of them for quite a while.

GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised by LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning some kind of directory for these kinds of materials. In a situation where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH s

If changes are authorized and there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns the changes.

But the law does not allow anyone to become the distributor of the product for the entire world. In today's electronic environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a single library. Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for

Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without paying for it; there should be some compensation. But the truth of the world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more until he becomes a big guy.

## License Information

LicenseID: LicenseRef-Public-domain
LicenseName: Public domain software
ExtractedText: <text> Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. If the source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of noncopylefted free software, which means that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all.

In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available. This is not free software, because free software requires accessibility of source code. Meanwhile, most free software is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted, and the copyright holders have legally given permission for everyone to use it in freedom, using a free software license.

Sometimes people use the term “public domain” in a loose fashion to mean “free” or “available gratis.” However, “public domain” is a legal term and means, precisely, “not copyrighted”. For clarity, we recommend using “public domain” for that meaning only, and using other terms to convey the other meanings.

Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything written down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs. Therefore, if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain, you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it; otherwise, the program is copyrighted. </text>
