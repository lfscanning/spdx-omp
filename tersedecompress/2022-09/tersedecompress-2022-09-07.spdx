copyright law in the United States. The U.S. Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright laws for two purposes: 1) to encourage the creation and dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole; and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.
copyright protection is simply originality. This is a low standard and means that a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain

For example, the results of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes impure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable. On the other hand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion

copyright implications until after the fact. PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
copyright in advance. One's bargaining power is much greater up front than it is down the road.
copyright, for example, any work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is in the public domain in the United States. The issue is not wholly free of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain outside the United States. Other materials in the public domain include: any works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work published in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose
copyright was not renewed. In talking about the new technology and putting material in a digital form to send all over the world, PETERS cautioned, one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an issue in the United States, they may be in different parts of the world,

copyright holding. Simply, economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in any form. They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for hire, the employer. The second right, which is critical to conversion, is the right to change a work. The right to make new versions is perhaps one of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an electronic world. The third right is the right to publish the work and the right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an electronic medium needs to know. The basic rule is if a copy is sold, all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy. The key is that it must be
copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as preservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and other libraries. But the law does not allow anyone to become the distributor of the product for the entire world. In today's electronic environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a single library. Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for

Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not copyrightable because they are mechanical. It can be argued whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected. One must exercise care with material created with public funds and generally in the public domain. An article written by a federal employee, if written as part of official duties, is not copyrightable. However, control over a scientific article written by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy.

If one purchases a computer software package, such as MacPaint, and creates something new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.
copyright matters, rough justice is the outcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their due. Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without paying for it; there should be some compensation. But the truth of the world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more until he becomes a big guy. That is true of every author, every composer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.
Copyright always originates with the author, except in cases of works made for hire. (Most software falls into this category.) When an author
copyright, though he retains the right to relinquish it. The author receives absolutely everything. The less prominent the author, the more leverage the publisher will have in contract negotiations. In order to transfer the rights, the author must sign an agreement giving them away.
Copyright ought to remain with the author, but as one moves forward globally in the electronic arena, a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes increasingly necessary.
copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with by many individuals, there is concern. If changes are authorized and there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns the changes. To put it another way, the person who acquires permission to change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless some agreement to the contrary has been made. It is typical for the original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the

copyright deposit operation start collecting these machine-readable versions? In the absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem. Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original electronic document. It becomes highly important in science to prove authorship. How will that be done?
copyright for works that were published in electronic form, including software, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty pages of code--something that represented the work but did not include the entire work itself and had little value to anyone. As a temporary measure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of electronic publications. This measure entails a proactive role for the Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version. Publishers then have perhaps a year to submit it. But the real problem for LC is what to do with all this material in all these different formats. Will the Library mount it? How will it give people access to it? How does LC
copyright problem. This desideratum will require propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they can end up in other on-line catalogs. Although uncertain about the mechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of cataloging and distribution of records. It would be foolish, given the amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work.

copyright would affect their lives, PETERS expressed the following cautions:

copyright infringement, or at least a letter demanding discussion of what one is doing.
copyright law in the United States. The U.S. Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright laws for two purposes: 1) to encourage the creation and dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole; and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.
copyright protection is simply originality. This is a low standard and means that a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain

copyright does not protect ideas, methods, systems--only the way
copyright protect anything that is mechanical, anything that does not involve choice, or criteria concerning whether or not one should do a thing. For example, the results of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes impure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable. On the other hand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion

copyright implications until after the fact. PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
copyright in advance. One's bargaining power is much greater up front than it is down the road.
copyright, for example, any work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is in the public domain in the United States. The issue is not wholly free of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain outside the United States. Other materials in the public domain include: any works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work published in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose
copyright was not renewed. In talking about the new technology and putting material in a digital form to send all over the world, PETERS cautioned, one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an issue in the United States, they may be in different parts of the world,

copyright holding. Simply, economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in any form. They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for hire, the employer. The second right, which is critical to conversion, is the right to change a work. The right to make new versions is perhaps one of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an electronic world. The third right is the right to publish the work and the right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an electronic medium needs to know. The basic rule is if a copy is sold, all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy. The key is that it must be sold. A number of companies overcome this obstacle by leasing or renting their product. These companies argue that if the material is rented or leased and not sold, they control the uses of a work. The fourth right, and one very important in a digital world, is a right of public performance, which m
copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as preservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and other libraries. But the law does not allow anyone to become the distributor of the product for the entire world. In today's electronic environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a single library. Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for example, from access and use. Hence, the development of site licenses and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they should be compensated for. Any solution that the United States takes today has to consider the international arena.
copyrighted material and put products together is how expensive the permissions process and managing it is. According to
copyright in a digital medium, whatever solution is worked out, will include managing and assembling the database. She strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible systems, in order to produce better results.
Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and totally exhaustive probably is not protected. In the event that what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable

Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not copyrightable because they are mechanical. It can be argued whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected. One must exercise care with material created with public funds and generally in the public domain. An article written by a federal employee, if written as part of official duties, is not copyrightable. However, control over a scientific article written by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy. If the government agency has no policy (and that policy can be contained in its regulations, the contract, or the grant), the

copyright. The World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 28 March through 2 April l993, at Harvard University, on digital technology, and will study this entire issue. If one purchases a computer software package, such as MacPaint, and creates something new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.
copyright matters, rough justice is the outcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their due. Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without paying for it; there should be some compensation. But the truth of the world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more until he becomes a big guy. That is true of every author, every composer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.
Copyright always originates with the author, except in cases of works made for hire. (Most software falls into this category.) When an author
copyright, though he retains the right to relinquish it. The author receives absolutely everything. The less prominent the author, the more leverage the publisher will have in contract negotiations. In order to transfer the rights, the author must sign an agreement giving them away.
Copyright ought to remain with the author, but as one moves forward globally in the electronic arena, a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes increasingly necessary.
copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with by many individuals, there is concern. If changes are authorized and there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns the changes. To put it another way, the person who acquires permission to change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless some agreement to the contrary has been made. It is typical for the original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the

copyright deposit operation start collecting these machine-readable versions? In the absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem. Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original electronic document. It becomes highly important in science to prove authorship. How will that be done?
copyright for works that were published in electronic form, including software, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty pages of code--something that represented the work but did not include the entire work itself and had little value to anyone. As a temporary measure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of electronic publications. This measure entails a proactive role for the Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version. Publishers then have perhaps a year to submit it. But the real problem for LC is what to do with all this material in all these different formats. Will the Library mount it? How will it give people access to it? How does LC keep track of the appropriate computers, software, and media? The situation is so hard to control, ERWAY said, that it makes sense for each publishing house to maintain its own archive. But LC cannot enforce that either.
copyright problem. This desideratum will require propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they can end up in other on-line catalogs. Although uncertain about the mechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of cataloging and distribution of records. It would be foolish, given the amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work. Re microforms, LYNCH said, we are in pretty good shape.

GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised by LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning some kind of directory for these kinds of materials. In a situation where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH suggested, RLIN is helpful, but it is not helpful in the case of a local, on-line catalogue. Further, one would like to have her or his system be aware that that exists in digital form, so that one can present it to a

copyright law in the United States. The U.S. Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright laws for two purposes: 1) to encourage the creation and dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole; and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.
copyright protection is simply originality. This is a low standard and means that a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain

copyright protect anything that is mechanical, anything that does not involve choice, or criteria concerning whether or not one should do a thing. For example, the results of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes impure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable. On the other hand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion

copyright implications until after the fact. PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
copyright in advance. One's bargaining power is much greater up front than it is down the road.
copyright, for example, any work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is in the public domain in the United States. The issue is not wholly free of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain outside the United States. Other materials in the public domain include: any works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work published in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose
copyright was not renewed. In talking about the new technology and putting material in a digital form to send all over the world, PETERS cautioned, one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an issue in the United States, they may be in different parts of the world,

copyright holding. Simply, economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in any form. They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for hire, the employer. The second right, which is critical to conversion, is the right to change a work. The right to make new versions is perhaps one of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an electronic world. The third right is the right to publish the work and the right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an electronic medium needs to know. The basic rule is if a copy is sold, all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy. The key is that it must be sold. A number of companies overcome this obstacle by leasing or renting their product. These companies argue that if the material is rented or leased and not sold, they control the uses of a work. The fourth right, and one very important in a digital world, is a right of public performance, which
copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as preservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and other libraries. But the law does not allow anyone to become the distributor of the product for the entire world. In today's electronic environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a single library. Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for example, from access and use. Hence, the development of site licenses and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they should be compensated for. Any solution that the United States takes today has to consider the international arena.
copyrighted material and put products together is how expensive the permissions process and managing it is. According to
copyright in a digital medium, whatever solution is worked out, will include managing and assembling the database. She strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible systems, in order to produce better results.
Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and totally exhaustive probably is not protected. In the event that what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable

Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not copyrightable because they are mechanical. It can be argued whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected. One must exercise care with material created with public funds and generally in the public domain. An article written by a federal employee, if written as part of official duties, is not copyrightable. However, control over a scientific article written by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy. If the government agency has no policy (and that policy can be contained in its regulations, the contract, or the grant), the

copyright. The World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 28 March through 2 April l993, at Harvard University, on digital technology, and will study this entire issue. If one purchases a computer software package, such as MacPaint, and creates something new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.
copyright matters, rough justice is the outcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their due. Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without paying for it; there should be some compensation. But the truth of the world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more until he becomes a big guy. That is true of every author, every composer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.
Copyright always originates with the author, except in cases of works made for hire. (Most software falls into this category.) When an author
copyright, though he retains the right to relinquish it. The author receives absolutely everything. The less prominent the author, the more leverage the publisher will have in contract negotiations. In order to transfer the rights, the author must sign an agreement giving them away.
Copyright ought to remain with the author, but as one moves forward globally in the electronic arena, a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes increasingly necessary.
copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with by many individuals, there is concern. If changes are authorized and there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns the changes. To put it another way, the person who acquires permission to change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless some agreement to the contrary has been made. It is typical for the original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the

copyright deposit operation start collecting these machine-readable versions? In the absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem. Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original electronic document. It becomes highly important in science to prove authorship. How will that be done?
copyright for works that were published in electronic form, including software, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty pages of code--something that represented the work but did not include the entire work itself and had little value to anyone. As a temporary measure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of electronic publications. This measure entails a proactive role for the Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version. Publishers then have perhaps a year to submit it. But the real problem for LC is what to do with all this material in all these different formats. Will the Library mount it? How will it give people access to it? How does LC keep track of the appropriate computers, software, and media? The situation is so hard to control, ERWAY said, that it makes sense for each publishing house to maintain its own archive. But LC cannot enforce that either.
copyright problem. This desideratum will require propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they can end up in other on-line catalogs. Although uncertain about the mechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of cataloging and distribution of records. It would be foolish, given the amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work. Re microforms, LYNCH said, we are in pretty good shape.
Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials. Of course that could not be accomplished overnight, but it would be something LC could plan for. GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised by LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning some kind of directory for these kinds of materials. In a situation where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH suggested, RLIN is helpful, but it is not helpful in the case of a local, on-line catalogue. Further, one would like to have her or his system be aware that that exists in digital form, so that one can present it to a
copyright. The only way to make those linkages would be to perform a tremendous amount of real-time look-up, which would be awkward at best, or periodically to yank the whole file from RLIN and match it against one's own stuff, which is a nuisance.
copyright?, she asked, because the journal will exist in the mainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it. Here the situation is different, ownership versus access, and is something that arises with publication in the on-line environment, faster than is sometimes realized. Lacking clear answers to all of these questions herself, LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role in helping to define some of them for quite a while.
copyrighted in this country, and second, to make materials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that goes beyond Congress, BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in electronic form. This would mean eventually accepting electronic formats. LC could require that at some point they be in a certain limited set of formats, and then develop mechanisms for allowing people to access those in the same way that other things are accessed. This does not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone. LC does that with most of its bibliographic records, BESSER said, which end up migrating to the utility (e.g., OCLC) or somewhere else. But just as most of LC's books are available in some form through interlibrary loan or some other mechanism, so in the same way electronic formats ought
copyright considerations. BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be established tomorrow, only that they seemed to fall within LC's purview, and that there should be long-range plans to establish them.
copyrighted database, LYNCH urged development of a network version of AM, or consideration of making the data in it available to people interested in doing network multimedia. On account of the current great shortage of digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights problems, this course of action could have a significant effect on making network multimedia a reality.
copyright problems.
copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium, and LC can request one copy of that, or two copies if it is the only version, and can request copies of software, but that fails to address magazines or books or anything like that which is in machine-readable form.

copyrights. There is a long held concept of &quot;abandonment&quot; in [[trademark law]], but it is a direct result of the infinite term of trademark protection. Currently, for copyrights to be abandoned, the owner must clearly release the copyright in a writing (which has been done). Non-owners of a copyright cannot merely claim the copyright &quot;abandoned&quot; and start using it without permission of the copyright holder, who would then have a legal remedy.
copyright concept of awarding a copyright creator a finite term where he/she may enjoy a monopoly on their expression. Under copyright law, a copyright owner has the right to profit or ''not'' profit on their creation. The basis for this right in the United States is the [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which empowers the [[United States Congress]]:
copyright law more conservative in deciding ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', 537 U.S. 186, which affirmed the legality of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], an act that extended the current copyright terms by an ''extra'' 20 years. The decision noted that, so long as a copyright term is finite, it is permissible under the Constitution. Thus, a copyright in the United States is protected by the full strength of the law until it expires, between 70 and 120 years after initial creation.
copyright==
copyright is frequently no longer defended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by its owners due to the software's age or obsolescence, but sometimes because the [[corporate]] copyright holder went out of business without transferring ownership, leaving no one to defend the copyright. (Copyrights on works created by an individual become the property of that person's [[estate (law)|estate]] after his/her death.) Nevertheless, some companies vehemently defend their rights to old games from which they're no longer making profit.
copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software is old enough for its copyrights to have expired, and even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually still belong to someone.
copyright is still in effect. Abandonware changes hands based on the presumption that the time and money that a copyright holder would have to spend enforcing the copyright is greater than any money the holder would earn selling software licenses. Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights. For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that makes money by selling Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.
copyright on software, putting it into the [[public domain]], or re-license it as [[freeware]] or [[open source]]. [[id Software]] is notable as an early proponent of this practice, releasing older titles under an [[open source]] license. Another example is [[Amstrad]], who support emulation and free distribution of [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software. Transfer of public domain or free software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware. It is uncommon for proprietary software companies to release software to the public domain or under an open source licence. However, many companies such as [[Novell]] and [[Sun]] have recently been experimenting with releasing their latest software under [[open source]] and [[free software]] licences which allow users not only to trade in the software freely but to sell and modify said software so long as they also release it under the same licence.
copyrights that are still of value== A common misconception is that &quot;abandonware&quot; is synonymous with &quot;old [[warez]]&quot;, that is, any software older than a certain threshold (a common one being five years). This is not always the case, as some software companies (like [[Apogee Software|Apogee]]) still offer many of their older titles for sale and actively pursue those who illegally offer them. [[Atari 2600]] games are commonly distributed on the Internet based on the presumption that no one would buy a primitive Atari game. However, [[mobile phone]] manufacturers have bought the rights to use these games, which can be made to work well on newer programmable mobile phones.

It was developed at the instigation of [[Victor Hugo]], and was thus influenced by the French &quot;[[French copyright law|right of the author]]&quot; (''droit d'auteur''), which contrasts with the Anglo-Saxon concept of &quot;copyright&quot;, which has only been concerned with economic protection.
copyright laws would usually only apply for works created within each country. Consequently, a work published in [[London]] by a British national would be protected by copyright in the [[United Kingdom]], but could be copied and sold by anyone in [[France]]; likewise, a work published in [[Paris]] by a French national would be protected by copyright in France, but could be copied and sold by anyone in the United Kingdom.

copyright on works of authors from other signatory countries (known as members of the ''Berne Union'') in the same way it protects the copyright of its own nationals, which means that, for instance, French copyright law applies to anything published or performed in France, regardless of where it was originally created.
copyright laws in the member states were totally different from each other, as that could render the whole agreement useless. Of what benefit would the agreement be if an author in a country with strong protection had his book published in a country with weak or no protection? Consequently, the Berne Convention is not just an agreement about how copyright should be regulated between the member states but, more importantly, a set of minimum standards that each country's copyright laws must meet.
Copyright under the Berne Convention is automatic; no explicit registration is required.
copyright protection]]. For photography the Berne Convention sets a minimum of 25 years protection from the year the photograph was created, and for cinematography the minimum is 50 years after first showing, or 50 years after creation if it hasn't been shown within 50 years after the creation. Countries under the older revisions of the treaty may choose to provide, and certain types of works (such as phonorecords and motion pictures) may be provided shorter terms.
copyright law of the country where protection is claimed shall be applied, article 7.8 states that &quot;unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work&quot;, i.e. an author is normally not entitled longer protection abroad than at home, even if the laws abroad give longer protection.

He immersed two thin solid lead plates separated by rubber sheets in a dilute sulfuric acid solution to make a secondary (rechargeable) battery. The original invention had a short shelf life, though. Around 1881, [[Émile Alphonse Faure]], with his colleagues, developed batteries using a mixture of [[lead]] [[oxide]]s for the positive plate electrolyte. These had faster reactions and higher efficiency. In 1878, the air cell battery was developed. In 1897, [[Nikola Tesla]] researched a lightweight [[carbide]] cell and an oxygen-hydrogen storage cell. In 1898 [[Nathan Stubblefield]] received approval for a battery patent (US600457): this electrolytic coil patent is referred to as an &quot;[[earth battery]]&quot;.

© Morisot was relegated to the category of &quot;feminine&quot; artists because of their usual subject matter &amp;mdash; women, children, and domestic scenes. However, as a doctrinaire impressionist, Morisot painted what she saw in her immediate, everyday life. As a woman securely in the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; she saw domestic interiors, holiday spots, other women, and children. Without exception, her subject matter shows the equivalent of that of her impressionist colleagues. [[Edgar Degas]], the dandy male bourgeois, painted rehearsals of the ballet, horse races, and nude women in apartments (rather than studios). [[Claude Monet]] painted his garden, his children, and his neighbor's haystacks. Female impressionists painted their social milieu in a way consistent with the impressionist approach to subject matter.

Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is a well established 'small scale industry' in parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[South East Asia]]. Besides catering to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst some sections of the [[Indian diaspora]], too. (In fact, bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the [[Government of Pakistan]] has banned their sale, distribution and telecast). Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by countless small cable TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia.

As for the Western sources, the Bollywood film industry was largely unknown to Westerners, who would not even be aware that their material was being copied. Audiences also may not have been aware of the plagiarism, since many in the Indian audience were unfamiliar with Western films and tunes.
copyright enforcement in South Asia is still hit or miss, Bollywood and Hollywood are much more aware of each other now, and Indian audiences are more familiar with foreign movies and music. Blatant plagiarism ''may'' have diminished -- however, there is no general agreement that it has.

Copyright''' (international symbol: '''©''') is a set of [[exclusive rights]] granted by [[government]]s to regulate the use of a particular expression of an idea or information. At its most general, it is literally &quot;the right to copy&quot; an original creation. In most cases, these rights are of limited duration.
Copyright may subsist in a wide range of creative or artistic forms or &quot;works&quot;. These include [[poem|poems]], [[drama|plays]], and other [[book|literary works]], [[film|movies]], [[choreography|choreographic works (dances, ballets, etc.)]], [[music|musical compositions]], [[sound recording|audio recordings]], [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[Computer software|software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcast]]s of live and other performances, and in some [[jurisdictions]] [[industrial design]]s. Copyright is a type of [[intellectual property]]; [[designs]] or [[industrial designs]] may be a separate or overlapping form of intellectual property in some jurisdictions.
Copyright law covers only the particular form or manner in which ideas or information have been manifested, the &quot;form of material expression&quot;. It is not designed or intended to cover the actual idea, concepts, facts, styles, or techniques which may be embodied in or represented by the copyright work. Copyright law provides scope for satirical or interpretive works which themselves may be copyrighted. See [[idea-expression divide]].
copyright which subsists in relation to a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon prohibits unauthorized parties from distributing copies of the cartoon or creating [[derivative work|derivative works]] which copy or mimic [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s particular anthropomorphic mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of artistic works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are sufficiently different to not be imitative of the original. Other forms of intellectual property may impose legal protection where copyright does not - such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.

copyright. First, the expansion of mercantilist trade in major European cities and the appearance of the secular [[university]] helped produce an educated [[bourgeois]] class interested in the information of the day. This helped spur the emergence of a “[[public sphere]],” which was increasingly served by entrepreneurial “stationers” who would produce copies of books on demand. Second, [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s development of [[printing press|movable type]] and the development and spread of the [[printing press]] made mass reproduction of printed works quick and cheap. Before these two developments, the process of copying a work could be nearly as [[labor intensive]] and expensive as creating the original, and was largely relegated to monastic [[scribes]]. It appears [[publishers]], rather than [[authors]], were the first to seek restrictions on copying printed works. Given that publishers now obtain the copyright from the authors as a condition of mass reproduction of
copyright in the early modern period was the notice attached to the ''ha- Shirim asher li-Shelomo'' by the composer [[Salomone Rossi]], a setting of the [[Psalms]] which was in fact the first music to be printed with a Hebrew type-face text(1623). It set out a rabbinical curse on anyone who copied the contents.
copyright originated in 1710 with the British [[Statute of Anne]]. This statute first accorded exclusive rights to authors rather than publishers, and it included protections for consumers of printed work ensuring that publishers could not control their use after sale. It also limited the duration of such exclusive rights to 28 years, after which all works would pass into the [[public domain]].
copyrights between sovereign nations. Under the Berne convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically assigned: an author does not have to &quot;register&quot; or &quot;apply for&quot; a copyright. As soon as a work is &quot;fixed&quot;, that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all exclusive rights to the work and any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires.
copyright methodology==
Copyright law of the United Kingdom]]''
copyright law as soon as it leaves that person's mind and is placed in some physical form, be it a painting, a musical work written in manuscript or an architectural schematic. Once in physical form, as long as it is an original work (in the sense of not having been copied from an existing work, rather than in the sense of being novel or unique), copyright in that work is automatically vested in (i.e. owned by) the person who put the concept into material form. There may be exceptions to this rule, depending on the nature of the work, whether it was created in the course of employment and the purposes for which the work was created.
copyright in their obscure work. Taking some precautionary steps may help to establish independent creation and authorship.
copyright in at least the underlying code of that website. A common and simple practice to obtain evidence in favour of authorship is to place the copyright material in an envelope or package together with a document signed by several people stating that they have examined the work prior to it being sealed and that in their opinion it is original. Once this is done the package is mailed to the owner by recorded delivery, which helps to establish when the work was created, who the originator of the work is and that there are signatory validators prepared to state that it is original. Once this process is complete the package and contents may be able to be used in a court of law as evidence if necessary.

Copyright Act of 1790]], and has changed and updated statutory copyright law multiple times since. The [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], though it has been modified since its enactment, forms the basis of copyright law in the United States today.
copyright protection from all publications produced by the United States Government, and its agents or employees while in their employment. The specific language is as follows:
Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of the United States Government, but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.&quot;'''
copyright attaches. The same is true of court decisions. It is not difficult to see the motivations behind this:
copyrightable for reasons of public policy. This applies to such works whether they are Federal, State, or local as well as to those of foreign governments.'' (The Compendium of Copyright Office Practices (Compendium II) section 206.01[[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/law/copyright/faq/part3/]] Paragraph 3.6 at 14 February 2006)
copyright law, in some respects. The American threshold for copyright protection does contain requirements of both originality and creativity. According to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc v Nation Enterprises'', a work “must be original to the author”. The United States Supreme Court has also interpreted Article I, § 8, cl 8 of the United States Constitution as requiring “independent creation plus a modicum of creativity”.
copyright laws dates to 1834, when the Supreme Court interpreted the first federal copyright laws and held that “no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court … “ In the same case it was argued – and accepted by the Court – that “it would be absurd, for a legislature to claim the copyright; and no one else can do it, for they are the authors, and cause them to be published without copyright … Statutes were never copyrighted.” Further, “it is the bounden duty of government to promulgate its statutes in print”. Counsel emphasised the governing policy that “all countries … subject to the sovereignty of the laws” hold the promulgation of the laws, from whatever source, “as essential as their existence.” “If either statutes or decisions could be made private property, it would be in the power of an individual to shut out the light by which we guide our actions.” (''Wheaton v Peters'', 33 US (8 Pet) 591, 668 (
copyright to a court reporter in his opinions of the [[Ohio Supreme Court]], on the grounds that “There has always been a judicial consensus, from the time of the decision in the case of ''Wheaton v Peters'', that no copyright could, under the statutes passed by [[Congress]], be secured in the products of the labour done by judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties. The whole work done by the judges constitutes the authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which, binding every citizen, is free for publication to all, whether it is a declaration of unwritten law, or an interpretation of a constitution or statute.”
copyright. In ''Howell v Miller'', (91 F 129 (1898)) Justice Harlan denied an injunction sought for the compiler of [[Michigan]] [[statutes]], holding that “no one can obtain the exclusive right to publish the laws of the state in a book prepared by him.” The question of formal ownership of the text of laws and decisions is perhaps secondary to the question of the dissemination of the law.
copyright==
copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some 'skill, originality and work' which has gone into it. However, even fairly trivial amounts of these qualities are sufficient for determining whether a particular act of copying constitutes an infringement of the author's original expression. In [[Australia]], it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work.
copyright has relatively recently been made automatic, which has had the effect of making it more like a property right. Thus, as with property, a copyright need not be granted or obtained through official registration with the government. Once an idea has been reduced to material form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape or a letter), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights. However, while a copyright need not be officially registered for the copyright owner to begin exercising his exclusive rights, registration of works (where the laws of that jurisdiction provide for registration) does have its benefits: serving as [[prima facie]] evidence of a valid copyright and enabling the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees (whereas in the USA, for instance, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits). The original hold
Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but may now become more commonplace as the copyright collectives like the [[RIAA]] are more and more targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far however, these cases have usually been settled outside of court, with demands of payment of several thousand dollars accompanied by nothing more than a threat to sue the file sharer, thus such cases do not even make it to civil law courts in reality.
copyright symbol does not mean that the work is not covered by copyright.
Copyright notices===
copyright when a work such as a book or movie is created the work generally should contain a ''copyright notice''. This notice is comprised by a letter c inside a circle (''i.e.'', ©), or the word &quot;copyright&quot;, followed by the year(s) of the copyright and the name of the copyright holder. Certain alternative formats were permitted for certain types of works. A copyright notice serves to inform any potential users that the work is copyrighted.
copyright in jurisdictions which have acceded to the Berne Convention. In most jurisdictions a work may be copyrighted from the moment of its creation regardless of whether or not it bears a copyright notice. However, the existence of a copyright notice may make it easier to claim certain [[damages]] for [[infringement]] in [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]], as a [[defendant]] may be presumed to have ignored the notice and intentionally infringed copyright.
copyright====
copyright are listed after the © symbol. If the work has been modified (i.e., a new edition) and recopyrighted, there will be more than one year listed.
Copyright#Rights of copyright holder|rights]] granted under existing copyright law are retained by the copyright holder and that legal action may be taken against [[copyright infringement]]. It was provided as a result of the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] of 1910, which required some statement of reservation of rights to grant international coverage in all the countries that were signatory to that convention. While it is commonplace to see it, this notice is now superfluous, as every country that is a member of the Buenos Aires Convention is also a member of the Berne Convention, which requires copyright to be valid without any formality of notice.
copyright law, such as works released under a [[copyleft]] license. This is a habitual formality and is unlikely to have legal consequences.
copyright holder==
copyright: to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies) to import or export the work to create derivative works (adapt the work) to perform or display the work publicly to sell or assign these rights to others
Copyright is often called a &quot;negative right&quot;, as it serves to prohibit people (e.g. readers, viewers, or listeners) from doing something, rather than permit people (e.g. authors) to do something. In this way it is similar to the unregistered design right in [[English law]] and [[European law]].
copyright law as an entity, and is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[moral right]]. Many argue that copyright does not exist merely to restrict third parties from publishing ideas and information, and that defining copyright purely as a negative right is contrary to the public policy objective of encouraging authors to create new works and enrich the public domain.
copyright&quot; and &quot;patent&quot; do not appear in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]; they are merely the forms of exclusive rights that the American [[legislature]] is constitutionally empowered to secure to accomplish the stated purpose of promoting the progress of science and useful arts (e.g. according to Article I, Section 8, Clause 8: &quot;Congress shall have Power [...] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot;).

copyright]]''
copyright covers the expression of an idea, not the idea itself &amp;mdash; this is called the idea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy. For example, if a book is written describing a new way to organize books in a library, a copyright does not prohibit a reader from freely using and describing that concept to others; it is only the particular expression of that process as originally described that is covered by copyright. One might be able to obtain a [[patent]] for the method, but that is a different area of law. Compilations of facts or data may also be copyrighted, but such a copyright is thin; it only applies to the particular selection and arrangement of the facts, not to the particular facts themselves. In some jurisdictions databases are expressly covered by statute.
Copyright law does ''not'' restrict anyone from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the [[United States]] this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s. Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder of their licensee to control the [[aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed '''does''' infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which applies to patents and trademark rights.
copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the [[United States]], the fair use doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined, however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Australia, the [[fair dealing]] exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyright material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and criti
copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''
Copyright law so that making 10 copies or more is considered commercial, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] effectively permits [[Digital rights management|DRM]] (Digital Rights/Restrictions Management) to prevent manufacture, importation, or distribution of recording devices if the device bypasses an access or copy control.
copyright regimes can differ greatly between countries. It would be dangerous to assume that an activity permitted by the laws of one country is necessarily permitted elsewhere.
copyright]]''
copyright as a whole fall broadly into two camps: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never been of net benefit to society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] (&quot;Rights of the Author&quot;), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the concept of copyright.
copyright as a concept to grant authors rights, but feel that it &quot;outlives its welcome&quot; by granting copyright for too long, far beyond the lifetime of the author, and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her. This is typically attributed to corporate [[lobbying]].
copyright system undermines its own goal (Boyle 1996, 142). The concepts of the [[public domain]] and the intrinsic freedom of information are necessary precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression. But these are gradually being eroded, as copyright terms are repeatedly extended to last beyond the lifetime of the audience which experienced and knows of the original work.
copyright scholars believe that irrespective of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that absent legal protection of their material interests, many valuable books and pieces of art would not be created. This interest is arguably served even by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, not only because many &quot;authors&quot; and copyright holders are corporations, but also because the right of an author's heirs to continue to profit from a copyrighted work may provide a substantial part of the incentive to create. Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain. By the time works currently enter the public domain, they almost always have become obsolete.
copyright-enforced monopoly rents[http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html]. Instead, these products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain; such a license is called a ''[[copyleft]]'' or ''[[free software license]]''.
Copyrighted works replicated onto digital media are easily and trivially copied via [[file sharing]]. Attempts to prevent this have been largely unsuccessful, and file sharing almost never results in severe consequences for the violators. Producers of copyrighted material often attribute losses in their sales to online copying, yet they generally continue to produce material and make profits. This lack of apparent effect has been gradually eroding the belief that copyright as presently constructed is indispensable. A few artists actually support the file sharing of their own works, arguing that it expands their audience to include people who would not otherwise be able or willing to legally purchase their material.
copyright (given that copyright laws have proven unenforceable), copyright holders use the legal system to apply extortion by charging for products that are readily available for free. [[Bill Gates]] is on record as saying that there is no way technically of preventing copyrighted digital material being replicated, so future attempts to enforce copyrights may become uneconomic, as well as unpopular politically. In the meantime, companies or indviduals held by a court to have infringed copyright may be required to pay substantial amounts in damages. A recent and highly visible example is the Australian [[Kazaa]] case, ''Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd'' [2005] FCA 1242 ([[5 September]] [[2005]]); the company operating the Kazaa file-sharing system and individuals associated with it were held to have authorised infringement of copyright in musical recordings. The recording industry is expected to seek multimillion dollar damages.
Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions may apply in such cases, the risks and the pressure from insurance companies usually prevents the use of materials without permission.
Copyright Term Extension Act]] extending the length of copyright under [[U.S. copyright law]] by 20 years were constitutionally challenged unsuccessfully in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The Court, in the case called [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]], held inter alia that in placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations. Other jurisdictions may have enacted legislation to provide for similar extensions of the copyright term.
copyright to their work but license it for free distribution (for example under a [[Creative Commons License]]). This has the benefit of providing a structured scheme under which authors can loosen some of the barriers that copyright imposes on others, allowing them to partially contribute the work to the community (in the form of giving a general grant on copying, reproduction, use or adaptation subject to certain conditions) while retaining other exclusive rights they hold in it.
Copyright social conflict]]''
Copyright is also conceived by some as an &quot;artificial barrier&quot; in that &quot;expressions&quot; could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[state]] does not necessarily possess the moral authority to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws.
Copyright concepts are perceived to be under challenge in the modern technological era, from the increasing use of peer to peer filesharing, to the downward trend in profits for major [[record labels]] and the [[Big Ten (movie studios)|movie industry]]. [[Public interest]] groups, major corporations and their like are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] have a curriculum entitled [http://www.mediainfocenter.org/story.asp?story_id=61684893 What's the Diff?] taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called [http://www.playitcybersafe.com Play it Cybersafe], which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. There seems to be a general consensus in the USA that there needs to be some curriculum materials for school-aged children on copyright. A public-wiki has been instal
Copyright may be assigned or transferred from one party to another. For example, a musician who records an album will sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyrights in the recordings to the company in exchange for royalties and other terms. One might ask why a copyright holder would ever give up his rights. The answer is that large companies generally have production and marketing capabilities far beyond that of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed for a minimal cost through the [[Internet]], however the [[record industry]] attempts to provide the service of promoting and marketing the artist so that the work can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder does not have to transfer all rights completely. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy and/or distribute the work in a particular region or for a spec
Copyright may also be [[license]]d. Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a [[statutory license]] (e g. musical works in the United States). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made. Failure to follow the proper procedures would then result in the copyist being vulnerable to an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following this process for every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performing rights organisation|performing rights organization]]s (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[RIAA]] and [[MPAA]]) have been formed to sell the rights to hundreds of works at once. Though
copyright law covers the creative or artistic expression of an idea, patent law covers [[invention]]s, trademark law covers distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s which are used in relation to [[product (business)|products]] or [[services]] as indicators of origin, registered designs law covers the look or appearance of a manufactured or functional article and the [[trade secret|law of confidential information]] covers secret or sensitive knowledge or information.
copyright. Titles and character names from books or movies may also be trademarked while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright.
copyright (and a patent) is generally subject to a statutorily-determined term, whereas a trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely if the trademark is periodically used and renewal fees continue to be duly paid to the relevant jurisdiction's trade marks office or [[registry]]. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the [[public domain]] and may be freely used or exploited by anyone, as courts in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publically available. It is completely incorrect, for instance, that simply posting material on the Internet places the material into the public domain such that anyone can freely copy, adapt or commercially exploit the work. Apart from anything else, the material may have been posted by someone who had no right to do so, let alone the power to waive copyright.
copyright lasts===
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions, with different categories of works and the length it subsists for also depends on whether a work is published or unpublished. In most of the world the default length of copyright for many works is either life of the author plus 50 years, or plus 70 years. Copyright in general always expires at the end of the year concerned, rather than on the exact date of the death of the author. In the United States, all books and other items published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain. In the US, government documents, regardless of date, are all public domain.
copyrighted work, following adoption of the [[WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (which in turn requires, inter alia, the implementation of the relevant provisions in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]). Two key moral rights are the right not to have the work altered or destroyed without consent, and the right to be attributed as the author of the work.
copyright case in the United States, Wheaton v. Peters, established that copyright was not a natural right or a common law right. Although the case was later nullified when the Supreme Court declared it null and void, it soon became a symbol for the morality of copyright. When the United States signed the Berne Convention, they stipulated that the Convention's &quot;moral rights&quot; provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering libel and slander.
copyright itself, which is regarded as an item of property which can be sold, licensed, lent, mortgaged or given like any other property). They can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.

In the summer of 1983, GUNT forces launched an offensive against government positions in northern and eastern Chad with Libyan support. In response to Libya's direct intervention, French and Zairian forces intervened to defend Habré, pushing Libyan and rebel forces north of the 16th parallel. In September 1984, the French and the Libyan governments announced an agreement for the mutual withdrawal of their forces from Chad. By the end of the year, all French and Zairian troops were withdrawn. Libya did not honor the withdrawal accord, and its forces continued to occupy the northern third of Chad.

Furthermore, Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé needed coalition partners.

The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;) in the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to guard against this mistake.
© Buée independently came upon the same idea which Wallis had suggested, that &lt;math&gt;\pm\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; should represent a unit line, and its negative, perpendicular to the real axis. [[Buée]]'s paper was not published until 1806, in which year [[Jean-Robert Argand]] also issued a pamphlet on the same subject. It is to Argand's essay that the scientific foundation for the graphic representation of complex numbers is now generally referred. Nevertheless, in 1831 Gauss found the theory quite unknown, and in 1832 published his chief memoir on the subject, thus bringing it prominently before the mathematical world. Mention should also be made of an excellent little treatise by [[Mourey]] (1828), in which the foundations for the theory of directional numbers are scientifically laid. The general acceptance of the theory is not a little due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex n

copyright law]] is seen by the original proponents of copyleft as a way to restrict the right to make and redistribute copies of a particular work, a copyleft license uses copyright law in order to ensure that every person who receives a copy or derived version of a work can use, modify, and also redistribute both the work, and [[Derivative work|derived versions of the work]]. Thus, in a non-legal sense, copyleft is the opposite of copyright. &lt;!--See discussion page of this article--&gt;
copyright law and the wrongs he perceived it perpetuating, he decided to work within the framework of existing [[law]]; he created his own copyright license, the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), the first copyleft license. For the first time a copyright holder had taken steps to ensure that the maximal number of rights be perpetually transferred to a program's users, no matter what subsequent revisions anyone made to the original program. This original GPL did not grant rights to the public at large, only those who had already received the program; but it was the best that could be done under existing law. The new license was not at this time given the copyleft label.
copyright law]], those who contribute to a work under copyleft usually must gain, defer or assign [[copyright]] holder status. By submitting the copyright of their contributions under a copyleft license, they deliberately give up some of the rights that normally follow from copyright, including the right to be the unique distributor of copies of the work. {{fact}}
copyright&quot; and &quot;all rights reserved&quot;, a phrase commonly used in copyright statements. Richard Stallman himself says the word comes from [[Don Hopkins]], whom he calls a very imaginative fellow, who mailed him a letter in [[1984]] or [[1985]] on which was written: &quot;Copyleft&amp;mdash;all rights reversed.&quot; [http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html] The term [[kopyleft]] with the notation &quot;[[All Rites Reversed]]&quot; was also in use in the early [[1970s]] within the [[Principia Discordia]], which may have inspired Hopkins or influenced other usage.

Thus, &quot;your program is covered by the copyleft&quot; is almost considered to mean the same as the program being GPLed. When used as a verb, as in &quot;he copylefted his most recent version&quot;, it is less precise and can refer to any of several similar licenses, or indeed a notional imaginary license for discussion purposes. See also the next section, which goes in detail about some definitional issues.
copyright's'' &quot;all rights reserved&quot; motto, or ''full copyleft's'' &quot;all rights reversed&quot;, ''share-alike'' licenses rather use the &quot;some rights reserved&quot; statement.

This approach uses copyleft primarily as a tool in a broadly scaled [[culture jamming|sniggling]] operation, whose aim is to permanently reverse such restrictions.
copyright law. In the [[public domain]] the absence of copyleft-like protection leaves software in an unprotected state. Developers basing their work on public domain originals can spread and sell undocumented [[Binary and text files|binaries]] without providing the source code. If legal copyright was abolished and without other means, then there would be no method for protecting or enforcing a copyleft license, but the need to do so would also be diminished (except from [[software hoarding]]).
copyright licenses''', because any works derived from a copylefted work must themselves be copylefted. This language is often used by those who feel that they may lose out as a result of copyleft provisions. In particular, copyleft works cannot legally be incorporated into works that are to be distributed without source, as is the case with most commercial products, without specific permission from the authors. As a consequence, the use of copyleft in industry is overwhelmingly limited to internal use.
copyrighted programs can be considered &quot;viral&quot; by the same definition, in that anything created from them can only be distributed under the terms imposed by the original author. Typically these terms will be much more restrictive than any imposed by copyleft licenses.
copyright licensing for software== Art &amp;mdash; documents=== Copyleft also inspired the arts (especially where traditional notions of [[intellectual property]] are experienced as hampering creativity and/or creative collaboration and/or easy distribution of art creations), with movements like the [[Libre Society]] and open-source [[record label]]s emerging. For example, the [[Free Art license]] is a copyleft license that can be applied to any work of art.

copyright law]] framework), such as [[open patent]] [[patent pool|pool]]s that allow royalty-free use of patents contributed to the pool under certain conditions (such as surrendering the right to apply for new patents that are not contributed to the pool). This has not taken off, perhaps in part because patents are relatively expensive to obtain, whereas copyright is obtained for free.
copyright law]], patenting mechanisms can threaten the copyleft freedoms attached to such creations, when [[patent law]] is allowed to overrule [[copyright]] (or in any other way limit the free expansion of copylefted creations), which might be the case for the new rules regarding [[patent]]s developed in the [[European Union]] in the early [[21st century]] (see also article on [[Community Patent]]). There seems to be no easy answer to such threats, while it is considered that generally communities developing copylefted products have neither the resources nor the organization for complex patenting procedures. However, an organized answer to such issues seems to start emerging from places like [[Groklaw]]. Also [[IBM]] could be considered by the [[open source community]] as rather an ally, when it comes to combining traditional [[copyright]] protection for copylefted creations with [[patent]]ed inventions, see: [http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/04/HNdonofirokeynote_1.html Infowo

The least that can be said is that copylefting in art tends toward keeping the art thus produced as much as possible out of the commercial arena&amp;mdash;which is considered as an intrinsic positive goal by some.

© depends on the program encoding used, it should be called '''Chaitin's construction''' instead of '''Chaitin's constant''' when not referring to any specific encoding.
© formally, we first need to fix a (Turing-complete) model of computation, for instance [[Turing machine]]s or [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] or [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] programs. (Here, ''program'' means the concatenation of executable code and input.) We then need to specify an [[Prefix code|instantaneous encoding]] of programs as [[bit]] strings. This encoding has the property that if ''w'' encodes a syntactically correct program, then no proper prefix of ''w'' encodes a syntactically correct program. Given an arbitrary Turing machine ''M'', this can always be achieved by using the following algorithm: Read a bit of the input ''z''. Before reading any more, simulate &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; on all possible extensions ''y'' (including the empty one) of ''z'' simultaneously until some extension halts, if ever. If ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z'', then halt and output ''M''(''y''); otherwise go to step 1.
© is then defined as:
© represents the probability that a randomly produced bit string will encode a halting program. This means that if you start flipping coins, always recording a head as a one and a tail as a zero, the probability is Ω that you will eventually reach the encoding of a syntactically correct halting program.

(The constant ''N'' heavily depends on the encoding choices and does not reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system in any way.)

© was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to catch on because it meant the player had to relearn how to play the instrument. Gradually, however, it became the standard and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the [[Oehler system]] clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland and Klezmer players continue to use Albert system clarinets, as the simpler fingering system can allow for easier slurring of notes. At one time the reed was held on using string, but now the practice exists primarily in Germany and Austria, where the warmer, ''thicker'' tone is preferred over that produced with the ligatures that are more popular in the rest of the world.

Ideally, camouflage should be made to break up and thereby conceal the structural lines of the object which it hides. Thus, the patterns often seen on camouflage clothing, masking cloth and vehicle paints are carefully constructed to deceive the human eye by breaking up the boundaries that define sharp edges and human silhouettes. This is called ''high difference'' or ''disruptive camouflage''.

Copyright Issues== There has been a move by the [[Record industry|recording industry]] to make audio CDs (CDDAs, [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] CDs) unplayable on computer CD-ROM drives, to prevent copying of the music. This is done by intentionally introducing errors onto the disc that the analogue circuits on most stand-alone audio players can automatically compensate for, but confuse CD-ROM drives. Consumer rights advocates are as of October 2001 pushing to require warning labels on compact discs that do not conform to the official Compact Disc Digital Audio standard (often called the [[Red Book]]) to inform consumers of which discs do not permit full [[fair use]] of their content.

As such the film was less Gothic and more of an horror film, extending the tale beyond the spectrum of the book. The characters Fran and Miriam (presumably named for 'Millarca') are similar to Laura and Carmilla. The animated film ''[[Vampire Hunter D|Vampire Hunter 'D': Bloodlust]]'' includes a character named Carmilla who is the lingering spirit of a long-dead yet very powerful vampire countess who continues to rule her castle. In [[1998]] ''Carmilla'' was updated to present-day [[Long Island]], [[New York]] in a film of the same name. The film is the brainchild of Jay Lind, the writer, director, and producer for the film.

Also, many argue that when the major media outlets are controlled by large corporations, access to information tends to become limited to what serves corporate interests, and corporate interests in turn are able to define the national political agenda. Finally when the majority of wealth of the politicians is invested into corporations, that gives politicians incentive to support the corporations.
© Berne-Joffroy, quoted in Gilles Lambert, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.8 note|early_life}}The Colonna were one of the leading aristocratic families in Rome, and part of a network of powerful connections that seemed to have supported the artist at crucial points in his life. Thus in 1606, following the death of Ranuccio, he fled first to the Colonna estates south of Rome, then on to Naples where Costanza Colonna Sforza, widow of Francesco Sforza, maintained a palace. Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples, another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy, and a sister was married into the locally important Carafa family - connections which might help explain the cornucopia of major commissions which fell into Caravaggio's lap in that city.

copyright''' is a form of [[copyright]] claim used by the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and a number of other [[Commonwealth realms]].
copyright applies to all works produced by the [[British Government]], subject to the condition that the qualification &quot;Where a work is made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties&quot; is met. The Crown can also have copyrights assigned to it. There is also a small class of materials where the Crown claims the right to control reproduction outside normal copyright law due to [[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] issued under the [[royal prerogative]]. This material includes the [[King James Bible]], and the [[Book of Common Prayer]].
Copyright Act 1911 (the [[1911]] [[Act of parliament|Act]]), removed the concept of common law copyright protection from [[British law]], and it also provided specific protection for government works for the first time. Crown copyright was defined to extend to any work prepared or published by or under the direction or control of [[George V of the United Kingdom|His Majesty]] or any Government department. The Copyright Act 1956 (the [[1956]] Act) further extended Crown copyright protection by extending the definition to include every original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work made by or under the direction or control of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty]] or a Government department; sound recordings or cinematograph films made by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or a Government department and works first published in the UK, if first published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or a Government department.
Copyrights Designs and Patents Act 1988 (the [[1988]] Act) came into force, the scope of the definition of Crown copyright was considerably reduced. Crown copyright was defined as subsisting when a &quot;work is made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties&quot;. Crown copyright was also defined as subsisting &quot;in every Act of Parliament, Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]], Act of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] or Measure of the General Synod of the [[Church of England]]&quot;. All existing works in Crown copyright were continued as such.
Copyright waived by the government, subject to certain conditions. This was introduced in a [[white paper]] in [[2000]] in order to improve access to government publications. There are 11 classes of copyrights for which waivers are granted. The document concerned, from [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO), is [http://www.hmso.gov.uk/archives/copyright/future_management_cc.doc Future Management of Crown Copyright]. Which documents are subject to waivers varies from time to time. [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/crown-copyright/copyright-guidance/index.htm The current list] may be found on the official site.
Copyright redistributable under such licenses as the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]]. For example, documents on the website of the [http://www.pro.gov.uk/default.htm Public Records Office]&quot; are subject to the following conditions:
copyright protection unless otherwise indicated. The Crown copyright protected material (other than the Royal Arms and departmental or agency logos) may be reproduced free of charge in any format or medium provided it is reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context. Where any of the Crown copyright items on this site are being republished or copied to others, the source of the material must be identified and the copyright status acknowledged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
copyright of a third party. Authorisation to reproduce such material must be obtained from the copyright holders concerned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
copyright varies depending whether material is published or unpublished. Unpublished material was originally subject to copyright protection in perpetuity. However, the 1988 Act removed this concept from British law. Transitional provisions apply for 50 years after the entry into force of the 1988 Act which mean that no unpublished material will lose its copyright protection until [[January 1]], [[2040]]. New Crown copyright material that is unpublished has copyright protection for 125 years from date of creation. Published Crown copyright material has protection for 50 years from date of publication. Those works protected under Letters Patent have perpetual copyright claimed over them despite being published. Works where copyright is assigned to the Crown by an author are subject to the normal term of protection for that particular type of work, for example life of the author plus 70 years for a literary work.
Copyright Act 1968]]'', the [[Australian Government]] owns copyright in any work, film or sound recording made by or under the direction or control of the Government, and any work first published by or under the direction or control of the Government.
Copyright Law Review Committee's report]. The chief recommendation was to end the distinction between the Crown and other copyright holders. In particular, the Committee was &quot;emphatic&quot; that the Crown lose its unique position of gaining copyright over material whenever it is the first publisher of such material. (For example, a previously unpublished short story, upon being published in a government work, would cease to belong to the author and would instead become Crown copyright, denying the author any future royalties.)
Copyright Act of Canada|Copyright Act]], the government reserves its rights with respect to all documents produced by the [[Government of Canada]].
copyright in the work shall ... belong to Her Majesty and ... shall continue for the remainder of the calendar year of the first publication of the work and for a period of fifty years following the end of that calendar year'' The Crown's ownership in its works is no more limited than those of any private persons. In practice, government materials are often licensed to the public for non-commercial use under the conditions that 1) due diligence is taken to ensure accuracy, 2) the source is identified, and 3) the material is not represented as an official version. Absent any licence available from the source of the material, there is no presumption that any government material is subject to such a licence.

copyright in the law. Section 12 of the Copyright Act is the provision dealing with Crown copyright. This section gives copyright to the Crown in works that are “prepared or published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or any government department.”

copyright generally, and not specifically in relation to the laws, should be maintained, but that the Crown in Right of [[Canada]] should, as a rule, place federal government information and data in the public domain.
copyright is asserted for generating revenue, licensing should be based on the principles of non-exclusivity and the recovery of no more than the marginal costs incurred in the reproduction of the information or data ... the federal government should create and maintain an inventory of Crown works covered by intellectual property that is of potential interest to the learning community and the information production sector at large; negotiate nonexclusive licenses for their use on the basis of cost recovery for digitization, processing and distribution; and invite provincial and territorial governments to provide similar services.
copyright in statutes and regulations, by permitting anyone to make copies without permission for any purpose – except commercial – while the other jurisdictions make fairly strongly worded prohibitions against copying the laws for anything other than personal use. It appears that perhaps the intent of these notices is to prevent copying by commercial publishers of the electronic version as prepared by the government, while permitting commercial publishers to manually type (or optically scan) the text of statutes if they wish to publish individual statutes (presumably with some value added to the raw legislative text).
Copyright Act, it is important to take note of the Reproduction of Federal Law Order, PC 1996-1995, 19 December 1996. The preamble states the basic principles that support the copyright notice.
copyright limits and to ensure that the electronic access to the law that is provided is not as functional as it could be.
copyright in statutes and court and administrative tribunal decisions is one that is rarely litigated. It has been used by some governments to justify a refusal to publish the laws electronically and to justify using the laws to generate revenues. One way to challenge these arguments is to question the legal theory of copyright in the laws, but perhaps the better way is to focus on the policy choices and arguments relating to access to the laws.
copyright in [[New Zealand]] is defined by Sections 2(1), 26 and 27 of the ''Copyright Act 1994''. The Crown is the first owner of any copyright subsisting in any work created by a person who is employed or engaged by the Crown, under a contract of service, apprenticeship, or a contract for services. It covers works of the Queen in right of New Zealand, Ministers of the Crown, offices of Parliament and government departments. For [[Crown entities]] and [[State-owned enterprises]], however, regular copyright provisions apply instead.
Copyright Acts until recently, the Crown acquired title by a kind of prerogative copyright in certain books or publications such as Acts of Parliament, Proclamations, and Orders in Council. However, there has been a deliberate divestment by the Crown of its copyright in law – principally in light of the policy considerations which hold that law should be freely available.
copyright -- Bills, Acts of Parliament, regulations, bylaws, Hansard, tabled select committee reports, court judgments, tribunal judgments, Royal commission reports, commission of inquiry reports, ministerial inquiry reports and statutory inquiry reports do not carry any copyright, regardless of age. Section 27(1) came into effect on [[1 April]] [[2001]]. There is, in New Zealand, under s 27 of the Copyright Act 1994, no copyright in regulations.

Landmark films such as ''[[The Thin Blue Line]]'' by [[Errol Morris]], which incorporated stylized re-enactments, and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger and Me]]'', which made claims of chronology that were later questioned by critics such as [[Pauline Kael]], placed far more overt interpretive control in the hands of the director. Indeed, the commercial success of the documentaries mentioned above may owe something to this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics usually refer to these works as &quot;[[mondo films]]&quot;.

© Bendixson theorem|systems that have two numbers describing a state]] are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood. The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes. For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Ruelle-Takens scenario|transition to turbulence of a fluid]]. The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random. In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories. The averages are well defined for [[ergodic theory|ergodic systems]] and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [[hyperbolic systems]]. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helpe
© developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the orbit &amp;gamma; and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to ''v(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)''. These points are a ''Poincaré section'' ''S(&amp;gamma;, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)'', of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the ''Poincaré map'' ''F : S &amp;rarr; S'', for points starting in ''S'' and returning to ''S''. Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.

As terms of the form &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ndash; &amp;sum; (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function ''h'', the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

The Director of Documentation for SNTE, Stéphane Dieu, commented in January 2005 &quot;It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways we don't approve&quot;.

To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and worldviews of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.

This policy changed in August 2003 to a more active one where writeups containing copyrighted material had to either conform to [[fair use]] guidelines (length limits, proportion of quoted material to new text) or be posted with permission.

The loss of a species in and of itself is an important factor, both as diminution of the enjoyment of nature and as a moral issue for those who believe humans are stewards of the natural environment. Destabilization is a well understood outcome, when an element of food or predation is removed from an ecosystem. Examples abound that other species are in turn affected, such that population increases or declines are forthcoming in these secondary species. Drastic change or an unstable spiral can ensue, until other species are lost and the ecosystem structure is changed markedly and irreversibly.

Etxebarrieta was soon killed by the Spanish police, leading to retaliation in the form of the first ETA assassination with major repercussions, was that of [[Melitón Manzanas]], chief of the [[secret police]] in San Sebastián and a suspected torturer. In [[1970]], several members of ETA were condemned to death in the ''[[Proceso de Burgos]]'' (&quot;Trial of [[Burgos]]&quot;), but international pressure resulted in [[commutation]] of the sentences, which, however, had by that time already been applied to some other members of ETA. The most consequential assassination performed by ETA during Franco's dictatorship was the December [[1973]] assassination by bomb in [[Madrid]] of admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], Franco's chosen successor and president of the government (a position roughly equivalent to being a [[prime minister]]).

After a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the ''&quot;[[Y Groups]]&quot;'', young people (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]) dedicated to so-called ''&quot;kale borroka&quot;'' &amp;mdash; street struggle &amp;mdash; and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]]s, garbage containers, etc. and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s.

Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. [[July 10]], [[1997]] PP council member [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque city of [[Ermua]] and his death threatened unless the Spanish government would meet ETA's demands. Six million people demonstrated to demand his liberation, with demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain. After three days, ETA carried through their threat, unleashing massive demonstrations reflecting the ETA action with the cries of &quot;Assassins&quot; and &quot;Basques yes, ETA no&quot;.

Many Spanish citizens took this rush to judgment as an offence towards the victims of the attacks and towards the Spanish people; this was generally seen as a decisive factor in the electoral result which overturned Aznar's government (see [[Spanish legislative election, 2004]]). The authorship of this attack, the largest European terror incident in terms of lives lost since the [[1988]] [[Pan Am flight 103]] flight bombing, has been finally ascribed to Islamist terrorists by the Spanish police. 20 February]] [[2004]]: Nine men and a woman are arrested, making the number of ETA suspects detained this week thirty three.

Through various avenues of intrigue, Elisabeth broke up Nietzsche's relationship with Rée and Salomé in the winter of 1882-83. (Lou Salomé eventually came to correspond with [[Sigmund Freud]], introducing him to Nietzsche's thought.) In the face of renewed fits of illness, in near isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, and plagued by suicidal thoughts, he fled to Rapallo, where in only ten days he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.

copyright based on originality.
copyright law that &quot;information&quot; is not copyrightable, O'Connor notes, but &quot;collections&quot; of information can be. Rural claimed a collection copyright in its directory. The court clarified that the intent of copyright law was not, as claimed by Rural and some lower courts, to reward the efforts of persons collecting information, but rather &quot;to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot; (U.S. Const. 1.8.8), that is, to encourage creative expression.
copyright is originality&quot;. However, the standard for creativity is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a &quot;spark&quot; or &quot;minimal degree&quot; of creativity to be protected by copyright.
copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange them it would destroy the copyright owned in the data.

copyrightable, but the words used to describe it are. Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe in your own words and publish it without infringing copyrights. But if you rewrote every recipe from a particular [[cookbook]], you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright in the choice of recipes and their &quot;coordination&quot; and &quot;presentation&quot;, even if you used different words, though the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity in the presentation.
copyright on the page numbers in its printed edition of those laws. By this reasoning, you could refer to a law or even include large excerpts with impunity, but if you reproduce it in such a way as to deliberately preserve West's page numbers, you might be in trouble. This [[copyright]] claim has been defeated in two court cases [http://www.tx-laws.com/ignoranceisnoexcuse.htm]. ''West v.

copyright law]] that provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor balancing test. The term &quot;fair use&quot; is unique to the United States; a similar principle, [[fair dealing]], exists in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions. U.S. [[trademark]] law also incorporates a &quot;fair use&quot; defense. While the names are the same, the doctrines are quite different.
copyright law|copyright law]] has a fair use doctrine based largely, or even exactly, on the doctrine adopted in the United States.
copyright&quot; was first ratified by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom]]'s [[Statute of Anne]] of [[1709]]. As room was not made for the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted content within this newly formulated statutory right, the courts gradually created a doctrine of &quot;fair abridgement&quot;, which later became &quot;fair use&quot;, that recognized the utility of such actions. The doctrine only existed in the U.S. as [[Common law|common law]] until it was incorporated into the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}, excerpted here:
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include&amp;mdash;
copyrighted work; the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
copyright's exclusive rights to serve the purpose of copyright law, which the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] defines as the promotion of &quot;the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot; (I.1.8).
copyright's exclusive rights, particularly the ''[[scenes a faire]]'' doctrine.
copyright law to stimulate creativity for the enrichment of the general public, or whether it aims to only &quot;supersede the objects&quot; of the original for reasons of, say, personal profit. In order to justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new. A key consideration is the extent to which the use is interpreted as ''transformative'', opposed to as merely ''derivative''. When [[Tom Forsythe]] appropriated [[Barbie]] dolls for his photography project &quot;Food Chain Barbie&quot;, [[Mattel]] lost its claims of copyright and trademark infringement against him because his work effectively parodies Barbie and the values she represents (cf. the 2003 9th Circuit case ''Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions''). However, when [[Jeff Koons]] tried to justify his appropriation of Art Rogers' photograph &quot;Puppies&quot; in his sculpture &quot;String of Puppies&quot; with the sam
copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of the work at issue, fair use analyses nevertheless consider certain aspects of the copied work, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional, to be germane. In order to prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, facts and ideas cannot be copyrighted&amp;mdash;only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. (See [[idea-expression divide]].) On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The Zapruder film of the assassination of President Kennedy, for example, was purchased and copyrighted by ''Time'' magazine. Yet their copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when they tried to enjoin the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject (see ''Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates'', [[Case citation|293
copyright law as &quot;bizarre and contradictory&quot; because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect. This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than from laws about copyright. This debate is still open in the courts.
copyrighted work that has been imported into the new work. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, e.g., a few sentences of a text for a book review, the more likely that the sample will be considered fair use. Yet see ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' for a case in which substantial copying &amp;mdash; entire programs for private viewing &amp;mdash; was upheld as fair use. Conversely, in ''[[Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]]'', [[Case citation|471 U.S. 539]] ([[1985]]), the use of less than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s memoir by a political opinion magazine was interpreted as infringement because those few words represented &quot;the heart of the book&quot; and were, as such, substantial.
copyright considerations as these were viewed as largely irrelevant. The infamously strict decision against [[rap]]per [[Biz Markie]]'s appropriation of a [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] song in the case ''[[Grand Upright v. Warner]]'', [[Case citation|780 F. Supp. 182]] ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1991), changed practices and opinions overnight. Samples now had to be licensed, so long as they rose &quot;to a level of legally cognizable appropriation&quot; (see ''[[Bridgeport Music Inc. v. Dimension Films]]'', [[Case citation|230 F. Supp.2d at 841]] [http://fsnews.findlaw.com/cases/6th/04a0297p.html]). In other words, ''de minimis'' sampling was still considered fair and free because, traditionally, &quot;the law does not care about trifles.&quot; The recent Sixth Circuit Court decision in the appeal to ''Bridgeport Music'' has reversed this standing. The new rule in that Circuit is even more strict in its rendering of copyright law: &quot;get a license or do not sample.&quot; Fair use does not come into
copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the defendant for commercial uses, but on the copyright owner for noncommercial uses. See ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'', [[Case citation|464 U.S. 417, 451]] ([[1984]]), where the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In the ''Nation'' case regarding President Ford's memoirs above, the Supreme Court labelled this factor &quot;the single most important element of fair use&quot; (471 U.S. at 566) and it has indeed enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme
copyright owner's official trailers. See ''[[Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista]]'', [[Case citation|342 F.3d 191]] ([[3d Cir.]] [[2003]]). On the other hand, one might well question whether [[Roland Barthes]]' ''S/Z'' clearly supersedes [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s short story &quot;Sarrasine&quot; as a market replacement, since it reproduces the entirety of the latter, though only in short fragments followed by much critical explication by Barthes. Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the licensing of course-pack copies. See ''[[Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan Document Services]]'', [[Case citation|99 F.3d 1381]] ([[6th Cir.]] 1999).
copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it, teach students about it, and possibly for other uses. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though he may sell his review commercially. But a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.
copyright infringement. This means that if the defendant's actions do not constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's rights (for example, because the plaintiff's work was not copyrighted, or the defendant's work did not borrow from it sufficiently), fair use does not even arise as an issue. However, it also means that, once the plaintiff has proven (or the defendant concedes) that the defendant has committed an infringing act, the defendant then bears the [[burden of proof|burden of proving]] in court that his copying should nonetheless be excused as a fair use of the plaintiff's work.
copyright suit threaten the publication of a completed work in which a publisher has invested significant resources, many authors may seek a license even for uses that copyright law ostensibly permits without liability.
copyrighted work have been sued for infringement by the targets of their ridicule, even though such use may be protected as fair use. The fair use cases addressing parodies distinguish between parodies &amp;mdash; using a work in order to poke fun or comment on the work itself &amp;mdash; and satires &amp;mdash; using a work to poke fun or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.
copyright without a fair use defense in the use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba's image [[search engine]]. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who argued that it is clearly covered under fair use. On appeal, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on [[July 7]], [[2003]]. The remaining issues were resolved with a default judgement after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.
copyrighted, so it can't be fair use''. Fair use describes conditions under which copyrighted material may be used without permission. If a work is not copyrighted, it's in the public domain and can legally be used without regard to fair use law.
copyright &amp;mdash; copyright law protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas, and so while citing the source for an idea prevents plagiarism, it is not necessarily needed to avoid infringing copyright if exact words are not used. On the other hand, one can plagiarize a work that is not protected by copyright. Noncommercial use is invariably fair''. Not true, though a judge may take the profit motive or lack thereof into account.
copyright the default for newly created works. For works produced between [[January 1]], [[1978]] and [[March 1]], [[1989]], copyright notice is required; however, registration was not required [http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#pub]. Any American works that did not have formal registration or notice fell into the Public Domain if registration was not made in a timely fashion. For international works, the situation is even more complex. International authors who failed to provide copyright notice or register with the U.S. copyright office are given additional contemporary remedies which may restore American copyright protection given certain conditions. International authors/corporations who fail to meet these remedies forfeit their copyright. An example of a company who failed to prove copyright was [[Roland Corporation]] and their claimed copyright on the sounds contained in their [[MT-32]] synthesizer. It's okay to quote up to 300 words''. The 300-word limit is re
copyright (such as free speech), but with different exceptions. Fair use is consistent with the more limited protection granted to trademarks, generally specific only to the particular product market and geographic area of the trademark owner.
copyright, that no more of the trademark is used than is necessary for the legitimate purpose. For instance, a word mark is preferred to a logo, and a word mark in the same style of type as surrounding text is preferred to a word mark in distinctive type.
copyright limitations can be found in many nations' copyright statutes, though these differ in scope. Most other [[common law]] countries have a related doctrine known as ''[[fair dealing]]'', which is defined in a constrained manner through an enumerated list of causes for exemption that allows little room for [[case law|judicial interpretation]]. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries have codified similarly specific and narrowly drawn exceptions. Fair use, however, tends to be an open-ended legal doctrine, as statutory factors are balanced by U.S. judges on a case-by-case basis rather than strictly applied.

This grip became popular amongst sports fencers in the late twentieth century because of the way it complemented the agility and athleticism of competitots - albeit, as critics allege, at the cost of blade sensitivity finesse. There are several types of pistol grips, such as the basic Visconti (which is what most people refer to as a pistol grip), the American, Belgian, and Russian. The various pistol grips all provide a somewhat firmer hold for the user of the weapon than would be possible with the French grip. This endows the user with a more stable grip on the weapon.

However, it was best described as an autocracy based on the Falangist fascist principles in its early years.

© Derrida, and the idea of relative truth. A synopsis of the logical chain goes like this. Heidegger is interested in the idea of [[Hermeneutics]], or the study of the methodological principles of interpretation. Everyone is Hermeneutic; therefore everyone is interpreting life/world as he/she encounters it. Therefore there is no final truth, everything is relative and nothing is absolute. To be human is to interpret. Along with this logical chain goes the idea of context. Heidegger states that you cannot discover anything without using your predetermined context: social, place, area, age, etc. You cannot decide upon an issue without using your already existing content. Therefore the idea of the universal, and the idea of [[Archetype]] are void. Another assault on [[Archetype]] states that since human beings value systems are based on context, therefore are relative voids Archetype. The final assault also comes from context: the idea that physical forms somehow have intrinsic value

copyright law as fan fiction is about reinterpreting officially sanctioned texts and reinventing them for the fan's own needs. As such, fan fiction cannot exist until the first copyright law, which went on the books in 1620 in England. The third theory holds that fan fiction did not officially start until the creation of Star Trek fandom and the printing of original stories by fans in their own fanzines. This theory acknowledges that much of the groundwork was laid by the science fiction fandom. Using this last theory of when fan fiction started, pastiche traditions al la Sherlock Holmes and Real Person Fic are not part of the fan fiction community because of vastly differing cultural practices.
copyright]] of the film, book, TV show, or other media on which it is based. The Internet has widened the scope considerably, allowing many more people than previously possible to share and critique fanfiction. Even a few of the authors of the original works on which the fan fiction is based may be among the readers.
copyright infringement and plagarism, but can still be found on independent websites by an author, SoupFiction.net and FictionAlley.org.
copyright]], copyright owners have the right to control or restrict the publishing of &quot;derivative works&quot; based on their material, though they do not receive ownership of those works. The owner of the original work (film, TV show, etc.) therefore may have some legal power over fan fiction, though the laws as written do not address the issue directly.
copyright law specifically protects parody, and also includes a provision that the specifically protected categories are not necessarily the only protected categories, fan fiction remains in a legal gray area. But even without an official ruling on the legality of fan fiction, the owners of intellectual property can exert a great deal of influence on fans. For instance, a [[cease and desist]] letter from an entity with deep pockets exerts a great deal of influence on a single person who can scarcely afford legal representation. Conversely, the bad publicity and ill will generated by attacking one's own fan base can give even a large corporation second thoughts about conducting a legal campaign against fan writers.
copyright issues, many characters in American television and film productions are also [[registered trademark]]s of the producing company. However, this only requires that fan fiction producers make certain that their work cannot be confused with the trademark holder, and does not claim to be endorsed or produced by them; it does not ban the use of a character any more than the registered trademark status of [[Coca-Cola]] prohibits its mention here. Most authors avoid legal trouble by including short disclaimers at the beginnings of stories or chapters.
copyright (and trademark) infringement can still occur even when the infringers do not profit; however, the non-profit nature of fan fiction is important legally, because it limits or eliminates the damages that a court could find and also makes possible some defense against claims of infringement under copyright [[fair use]].

However, there is some disagreement over who exactly owns or owned the copyrights and whether the copyrights for the majority of Lovecraft's works published post-1923 - including such prominent pieces as ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'' and ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' - have now expired.
copyrights for Lovecraft's works were ever renewed under the terms of the [[USA]] [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for works created prior to [[January 1]] [[1978]]. If Lovecraft's work had been renewed they would be eligible for protection for 75-95 years after the author's death according to the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998. This means the copyrights would not expire on some of Lovecraft's works until 2019 at the earliest, providing that no further laws extend the periods of copyrights within the USA. Similarly, the [[European Union]] [[Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection]] of 1993 extended the copyrights to 70 years after the author's death.

copyrights over Lovecraft's works. On [[October 9]], [[1947]] Derleth purchased all rights to ''[[Weird Tales]]''. However, since April 1926 at the latest, Lovecraft had reserved all second printing rights to stories published in ''Weird Tales''. Hence, ''Weird Tales'' may only have owned the rights to at most six of Lovecraft's tales. Again, even if Derleth did obtain the copyrights to Lovecraft's tales no evidence as yet has been found that the copyrights were renewed.[http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/Innsmouth/LovecraftCopyright.html]
copyright for Lovecraft's works would have been inherited by the only surviving heir of his 1912 will: Lovecraft's aunt, [[Annie Gamwell]]. Gamwell herself perished in 1941 and the copyrights then passed to her remaining descendants, [[Ethel Phillips Morrish]] and Edna Lewis. Morrish and Lewis then signed a document, sometimes referred to as the Morrish-Lewis gift, permitting [[Arkham House]] to republish Lovecraft's works but retaining the copyrights for themselves.

© introduced ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' (''Quick et Flupke''), a new comic strip about two street urchins from Brussels, in the pages of ''Le Petit Vingtième''. For many years, Hergé would continue to produce this less well-known series in parallel with his Tintin stories. In June, he began the second Tintin adventure, ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'' (then the [[colony]] of [[Belgian Congo]]), followed by ''[[Tintin in America]]'' and ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''.
© would continue revising these stories in subsequent editions, including a later conversion to colour. However, he would also express embarrassment over the ill-informed and prejudiced views expressed in these works. For instance, an infamous scene in ''Tintin in the Congo'' had Tintin giving a geography [[lesson]] to native students in a missionary school. &quot;My dear friends,&quot; exclaimed Tintin, &quot;today I am going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!&quot; In a later edition, the scene was changed into an arithmetic lesson.
© reached a watershed with ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', the fifth Tintin adventure. At the close of the previous ''Tintin'' strip, ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'', he had mentioned that Tintin's next adventure would bring him to [[China]]. Father Gosset, the chaplain to the Chinese students at the [[University of Leuven]], wrote to Hergé urging him to be sensitive about what he wrote about China. Hergé agreed, and in the spring of [[1934]] Gosset introduced him to [[Chang Chong-jen]] (Chang Chongren), a young sculpture student at the Brussels Académie des Beaux-Arts. The two young artists quickly became close friends, and Chang introduced Hergé to Chinese history, culture, and the techniques of [[Chinese art]]. As a result of this experience, Hergé would strive in ''The Blue Lotus'', and in subsequent Tintin adventures, to be meticulously accurate in depicting the places which Tintin visited. As a token of appreciation, he added a fictional &quot;[[Chang Chong-Chen]]&quot; to ''The Blue Lo
© became increasingly aware of the problems of [[colonialism]], in particular the [[Japan|Japanese Empire's]] advances into China. ''The Blue Lotus'' carries a bold anti-imperialist message, contrary to the prevailing view in the West, which was sympathetic to Japan and the colonial enterprise. As a result, it drew sharp criticism from various parties, including a protest by Japanese diplomats to the Belgian Foreign Ministry. However, the passage of time has since vindicated Hergé's views.

© was mobilized as a reserve lieutenant, and had to interrupt Tintin's adventures in the middle of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]''. Nevertheless, by the summer of [[1940]], Belgium had fallen to Germany with the rest of [[Continental Europe]].
© accepted an offer to produce a new Tintin strip in ''[[Le Soir]]'', Brussels' leading French daily, which had been appropriated as the mouthpiece of the occupation forces. He had to leave ''The Land of the Black Gold'' unfinished, due to its anti-fascist overtones, launching instead into ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', the first of six Tintin stories which he would produce during the war.
© had to introduce more frequent gags and faster-paced action. Secondly, Hergé had to move the focus of Tintin's adventures away from current affairs, in order to avoid controversy. He turned to stories with an escapist flavour: an expedition to a meteorite (''[[The Shooting Star]]''), a treasure hunt (''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' and ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]''), and a quest to undo an ancient [[Inca]] curse (''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'' and ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'').
© placed more emphasis on characterization than on the plot, and indeed Tintin's most memorable companions, [[Captain Haddock]] and [[Cuthbert Calculus]] (In French Professeur Tryphon Tournesol), were introduced at this time. Haddock debuted in ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' and Calculus in ''Red Rackham's Treasure''. The impact of these changes were not lost on the readers; in reprint, these stories have proven to be amongst the most popular.
© met [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs]], another comics artist, whom he hired to help revise the early Tintin albums. Jacob's most significant contribution would be his redrawing of the costumes and backgrounds in the revised edition of ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]''. He also began collaborating with Hergé on a new Tintin adventure, ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' (see above).
© was arrested four times by different groups. He was publicly accused of being a [[Nazi]]/[[Rexism|Rexist]] sympathizer, a claim which was largely unfounded, as the Tintin adventures published during the war were scrupulously free of politics (the only dubious point occurring in ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', which showed a rival scientific expedition flying the [[Flag of the United States]]). In fact, the stories published before the war had been unequivocally critical of [[fascism]]; most prominently, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' showed Tintin working to defeat a thinly-veiled allegory of the [[Anschluss]], [[Nazi Germany]]'s takeover of [[Austria]]. Nevertheless, like other former employees of the Nazi-controlled press, Hergé found himself barred from newspaper work. He spent the next two years working with Jacobs, as well as a new assistant, Alice Devos, adapting many of the early Tintin adventures into colour.
© refused and ended their hitherto fruitful collaboration. Jacobs then went on to produce his own comics for ''Tintin magazine'', including the widely-acclaimed ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''.
© began to take their toll. In [[1949]], while working on the new version of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' (the first version had been left unfinished by the outbreak of [[World War II]]), Hergé suffered a nervous breakdown and was forced to take an abrupt four month-long break. He suffered another breakdown in early [[1950]], while working on ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]''.

The normally rich cast of characters was pared to a minimum - Tintin, Captain Haddock, and the [[Sherpa (people)|sherpa]] Tharkey - as the story focused on Tintin's dogged search for Chang. Hergé came to regard this highly personal and emotionally riveting Tintin adventure as his favorite. The completion of the story seemed also to signal an end to his problems: he was no longer troubled by nightmares, divorced Germaine in [[1975]] (they had separated in [[1960]]), and finally married Fanny Vlaminck in [[1977]].

He travelled widely across [[Europe]], and in [[1971]] visited [[United States|America]] for the first time, meeting some of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] whose culture had long been a source of fascination for him. In [[1973]], he visited [[Taiwan]], accepting an invitation offered three decades ago by the [[Kuomintang]] government, in appreciation of ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''.

copyright]] may subsist in creative and artistic works (eg. books, movies, music, paintings, photographs and software), giving a copyright holder the exclusive right to control reproduction or adaptation of such works for a certain period of time. A [[patent]] may be granted in relation to an [[invention]] that is new, useful and not simply an obvious advancement over what existed when the application was filed. A patent gives the holder an exclusive right to commercially exploit the invention for a certain period of time (typically 20 years from the filing date of a patent application). A [[trademark]] is a distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is used to distinguish the products or services of one [[business]] from those of another business. An [[industrial design right]] protects the form of appearance, style or design of an industrial object (eg. spare parts, furniture or textiles). A [[trade secret]] (also known as &quot;confidential information&quot;) is an item of [
copyright) and those that grant a right to prevent others from doing something. The difference between these is that a copyright would prevent someone from copying the material form of expression of an idea, but could not stop them from expressing the same idea in a different form, nor from using the same form of expression if they had no knowledge of the original held by the copyright holder. Patents and trade marks on the other hand, can be used to prevent that second person from making the same design even if they had never heard of or seen the claimed &quot;property&quot;. Those rights must be applied for or registered and are more expensive to enforce.
Copyright was not invented until after the advent of the printing press and wider public literacy. In [[England]] the King was concerned by the unfair copying of books and used the [[royal prerogative]] to pass the Licensing Act [[1662]] which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers Company. The [[Statute of Anne]] was the first real act of copyright, and gave the author rights for a fixed period. Internationally, the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in the late [[1800s]] set out the scope of copyright protection and is still in force to this day.

copyrights frequently used the term ''property'' to advance that agenda, while others who supported a more limited system sometimes used the term ''[[intellectual rights]]'' (''droits intellectuels'').

It is important to appreciate that different countries may have subtle or dramatic differences in the scope or protection and permitted uses of different types of intellectual property. A fair use in one jurisdiction can easily be an infringing use elsewhere.

By contrast, physical property laws rarely restrict the sale or modification of physical copies of a work (something that many copyright laws do restrict).

[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml] Furthermore, most legal systems, including that of the [[United States]], hold that exclusive rights are a government grant, rather than a fundamental right held by citizens.
copyright infringement]] is not punishable by laws against [[theft]] or [[trespass]], but rather by an entirely different set of laws with different penalties. [[patent infringement|Patent infringement]] is not a criminal offense although it may subject the infringer to civil liability. Willfully possessing stolen physical goods is a criminal offense while mere possessing of goods which infringe on copyright is not. Furthermore, in the United States physical property laws are generally part of state law, while copyright law is in the main measure federal.
copyright is. In these cases too the law accepts that the property cannot be stolen - if someone moves into a flat and prevents the original residents from living there they are not regarded as 'thieves of the lease' but as '[[squatter|squatters]]' and the law provides different remedies. [[Identity theft]] is another example of the adaptation of physical property laws to intangible items, though that term itself is seen as problematic by some.

These critics see this assertion as [[propaganda]] for a &quot;property view&quot; of the intellectual property laws, and suggest alternative terms such as [[individual capital]], [[instructional capital]] and [[social capital]] over the term &quot;[[intellectual capital]],&quot; which has an ambiguous status, even among believers in [[neoclassical economics]]. Indeed, recent historical and econometric research has begun to &quot;chall

This would allow, in essence, the creation of a book which would disintegrate after one reading. As individuals have proven adept at circumventing such measures in the past, many copyright holders have also successfully lobbied for laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which uses criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital &quot;rights management&quot; systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC).

copyright was invented. One might argue that much more invention occurred after patents came into existence; however, one could also argue that patents were brought into law as the power and influence of industrial interests grew.
copyright in the database structure. This notion was opposed by the United States Supreme Court in 1991 in the Feist Publication finding, which said that exclusive rights cannot cover the factual elements of any copyrighted work, that copyright does not derive from the effort expended in the production of the work, and that in the case of a collection of information, only the originality that may be found in the selection and arrangement of the information is governed by copyright. This case holds that the purpose of exclusive rights policy is to provide information to the public, and this consideration takes priority over concerns such as investment. A study has found that the introduction of exclusive rights to databases in the EU did not do any good to the economy.

copyrighted &amp;mdash; the dispute was based on the fact that King had made his speech publicly to a large audience both live and televised, and only one month later did he register for copyright of his speech (as was then required by [[United States copyright law|U.S. copyright law]]). Finally, on November 5, 1999, in ''[[Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]'', the 11th circuit of the United States Court of Appeals ruled that the public performance of his speech did not constitute &quot;general publication&quot; nor did it forfeit his copyright. Thus, King's [[estate]] is able to forbid redistribution of the speech or require a license fee, but they have since made the speech available to the [[Douglass Archives of American Public Address]] under terms that grant permission to &quot;download, reprint, and/or otherwise redistribute this file, provided this distribution statement is included and appropriate point of origin credit is given to the preparer and Dougl

ExtractedText: <text> Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. If the source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of noncopylefted free software, which means that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all.

In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available. This is not free software, because free software requires accessibility of source code. Meanwhile, most free software is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted, and the copyright holders have legally given permission for everyone to use it in freedom, using a free software license.

Sometimes people use the term “public domain” in a loose fashion to mean “free” or “available gratis.” However, “public domain” is a legal term and means, precisely, “not copyrighted”. For clarity, we recommend using “public domain” for that meaning only, and using other terms to convey the other meanings.

Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything written down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs. Therefore, if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain, you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it; otherwise, the program is copyrighted. </text>
